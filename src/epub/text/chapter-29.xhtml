<p>The girl screamed and gripped Michael’s arm.</p>

<p>“What is that?” she asked. “Is it the
Thing that came to my—my room?”</p>

<p>Michael put her aside gently, and ran toward
the tower. As he did so, Bhag took a leap
and dropped on the ground. For a moment he
stood, his knuckles on the ground, his malignant
face turned in the direction of the man. And
then he sniffed, and, with that queer twittering
noise of his, went ambling across the downs
and disappeared over a nearby crest.</p>

<p>Michael raced in pursuit. By the time he
came into view, the great ape was a quarter of
a mile away, running at top speed, and always
keeping close to the hedges that divided the
fields he had to cross. Pursuit was useless,
and the detective went slowly back to the
alarmed company.</p>

<p>“It is only an orang-outang belonging to Sir
Gregory, and perfectly harmless,” he said.
“He has been missing from the house for two
or three days.”</p>

<p>“He must have been hiding in the tower,”
said Knebworth, and Michael nodded. “Well,
I’m darned glad he didn’t choose to come out
at the moment I was shooting,” said the
director, mopping his forehead. “You didn’t
see anything of him, Adele?”</p>

<p>Michael guessed that the girl was pale under
her yellow make-up, and the hand she raised
to her lips shook a little.</p>

<p>“That explains the mystery of the handcuffs,”
said Knebworth.</p>

<p>“Did you notice them?” asked Michael
quickly. “Yes, that explains the broken link,”
he said, “but it doesn’t exactly explain the
butyl chloride.”</p>

<p>He held the girl’s arm as he spoke, and in
the warm, strong pressure she felt something
more than his sympathy.</p>

<p>“Were you a little frightened?”</p>

<p>“I was badly frightened,” she confessed.
“How terrible! Was that Bhag?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“That was Bhag,” he said. “I suppose
he’s been hiding in the tower ever since his
disappearance. You saw nothing when you
were on the top of the wall?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to say I didn’t, or I should have
dropped. There are a large number of bushes
where he might have been hidden.”</p>

<p>Michael decided to look for himself. They
put up the ladder and he climbed to the broad
top of the tower and looked down. At the base
of the stonework the ground sloped away in a
manner curiously reminiscent of the shell-holes
he had seen during the war in France. The
actual floor of the tower was not visible under
the hawthorn bushes which grew thickly at the
centre. He caught a glimpse of the jagged
edges of rock, the distorted branches of an old
tree, and that was all.</p>

<p>There was ample opportunity for concealment.
Possibly Bhag had hidden there most
of the time, sleeping off the effects of his labour
and his wounds; for Michael had seen something
that nobody else had noticed—the gashed
skin, and the ear that had been slashed in half.</p>

<p>He came down the ladder again and rejoined
Knebworth.</p>

<p>“I think that finishes our work for to-day,”
said Jack dubiously. “I smell hysteria, and it
will be a long time before I can get the girls
to come up for a night picture.”</p>

<p>Michael drove the director back in his car,
and all the way home he was considering this
strange appearance of the ape. Somebody had
handcuffed Bhag: he ought to have guessed
that when he saw the torn link. No human
being could have broken those apart. And
Bhag had escaped—from whom? How?
And why had he not returned to Griff Towers
and to his master?</p>

<p>When he had dropped the director at the
studio he went straight on to Gregory’s house,
and found the baronet playing clock-golf on a
strip of lawn that ran by the side of the house.
The man was still heavily bandaged, but he
was making good recovery.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bhag is back. He returned half an
hour ago. Where he has been, heaven knows!
I’ve often wished that chap could talk, but I’ve
never wished it so much as I do at this moment.
Somebody had put irons on him: I’ve just taken
them off.”</p>

<p>“Can I see them?”</p>

<p>“You knew it, did you?”</p>

<p>“I saw him. He came out of the old tower
on the hill.” Michael pointed; from where
they stood, the tower was in sight.</p>

<p>“Is that so? And what the devil was he
doing there?”</p>

<p>Sir Gregory scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“He’s been away before, but mostly he goes
to a shoot of mine about three miles away,
where there’s plenty of cover and no intruders.
I discovered that when a poacher saw him, and,
like a fool, shot at him—that poacher was a
lucky man to escape with his life. Have you
found the body of Foss?”</p>

<p>The baronet had resumed his playing, and
was looking at the ball at his feet.</p>

<p>“No,” said Michael quietly.</p>

<p>“Expect to find it?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised.”</p>

<p>Sir Gregory stood, his hands leaning on his
club, looking across the wold.</p>

<p>“What’s the law in this country, suppose a
man accidentally kills a servant who tried to
knife him?”</p>

<p>“He would have to stand his trial,” said
Michael, “and a verdict of ‘justifiable
homicide’ would be returned and he would be
set free.”</p>

<p>“But suppose he didn’t reveal it? Suppose
he—well, did away with the body—buried it—and
let the matter slide?”</p>

<p>“Then he would place himself in a remarkably
dangerous position,” said Michael.
“Particularly”—he watched the man closely—“if
a woman friend, who is no longer a woman
friend, happened to be a witness or had knowledge
of the act.”</p>

<p>Gregory Penne’s one visible eye blinked
quickly, and he went that curious purple colour
which Michael had seen before when he was
agitated.</p>

<p>“Suppose she tried to get money out of him
by threatening to tell the police?”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the patient Michael, “she
would go to prison for blackmail, and possibly
as an accessory to or after the fact.”</p>

<p>“Would she?” Sir Gregory’s voice was
eager. “She would be an accessory if she saw—him
cut the man down? Mind you, this
happened years ago. There’s a Statute of
Limitations, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Not for murder,” said Michael.</p>

<p>“Murder! Would you call that murder?”
asked the other in alarm. “In self-defence?
Rot!”</p>

<p>Things were gradually being made light to
Michael. Once Stella Mendoza had called the
man a murderer, and Michael’s nimble mind,
which could reconstruct the scene with almost
unerring precision, began to grow active. A
servant, a coloured man, probably, one of his
Malayan slaves, had run amok, and Penne had
killed him—possibly in self-defence—and then
had grown frightened of the consequences. He
remembered Stella’s description—“Penne is a
bluffer and a coward at heart.” That was the
story in a nutshell.</p>

<p>“Where did you bury your unfortunate
victim?” he asked coolly, and the man started.</p>

<p>“Bury? What do you mean?” he blustered.
“I didn’t murder or bury anybody. I was
merely putting a hypothetical case to you.”</p>

<p>“It sounded more real than hypothesis,” said
Michael, “but I won’t press the question.”</p>

<p>In truth, crimes of this character bored
Michael Brixan; and, but for the unusual and
curious circumstances of the Head-Hunter’s
villainies, he would have dropped the case
almost as soon as he came on to it.</p>

<p>There was yet another attraction, which he
did not name, even to himself. As for Sir
Gregory Penne, the grossness of the man and
his hobbies, the sordid vulgarity of his amours,
were more than a little sickening. He would
gladly have cut Sir Gregory out of life, only—he
was not yet sure.</p>

<p>“It is very curious how these questions crop
up,” Penne was saying, as he came out of his
reverie. “A chap like myself, who doesn’t
have much to occupy his mind, gets on an
abstract problem of that kind and never leaves
it. So she’d be an accessory after the fact,
would she? That would mean penal servitude.”</p>

<p>He seemed to derive a great deal of satisfaction
from this thought, and was almost amiable
by the time Michael parted from him, after an
examination of the broken handcuffs. They
were British and of an old pattern.</p>

<p>“Is Bhag hurt very much?” asked Michael
as he put them down.</p>

<p>“Not very much; he’s got a cut or two,”
said the other calmly. He made no attempt to
disguise the happenings of that night. “He
came to my assistance, poor brute! This fellow
nearly got him. In fact, poor old Bhag was
knocked out, but went after them like a brick.”</p>

<p>“What hat was that man wearing—the brown
man?”</p>

<p>“Keji? I don’t know. I suppose he wore
a hat, but I didn’t notice it. Why?”</p>

<p>“I was merely asking,” said Michael carelessly.
“Perhaps he lost it in the caves.”</p>

<p>He watched the other narrowly as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Caves? I’ve never heard about those.
What are they? Are there any caves near
by?” asked Sir Gregory innocently. “You’ve
a wonderful grip of the topography of the
county, Brixan. I’ve been living here off and
on for twenty years, and I lose myself every
time I go into Chichester!”</p>
