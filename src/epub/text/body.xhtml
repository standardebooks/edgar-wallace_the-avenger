<p>Captain Mike Brixan had certain mild and
innocent superstitions. He believed, for
example, that if he saw a green crow in a field
he would certainly see another green crow
before the day was out. And when, at the
bookstand on Aix la Chapelle station, he saw
and purchased a dime novel that was comprehensively
intituled “Only an Extra, or the
Pride of Hollywood,” he was less concerned
as to how this thrilling and dog-eared romance
came to be on offer at half a million marks (this
was in the days when marks were worth money)
than as to the circumstances in which he would
again hear or read the word “extras” in the
sense of a supernumerary and unimportant
screen actress.</p>

<p>The novel did not interest him at all. He
read one page of superlatives and turned for
relief to the study of a Belgian time-table. He
was bored, but not so bored that he could
interest himself in the sensational rise of the
fictitious Rosa Love from modest obscurity to
a press agent and wealth.</p>

<p>But “extra” was a new one on Michael, and
he waited for the day to bring its inevitable
companion.</p>

<p>To say that he was uninterested in crime,
that burglars were less thrilling than golf scores,
and the record of murders hardly worth the
reading, might convey a wrong impression to
those who knew him as the cleverest agent
in the Foreign Office Intelligence Department.</p>

<p>His official life was spent in meeting queer
continentals in obscure restaurants and, in
divers rôles, to learn of the undercurrents that
were drifting the barques of diplomacy to
unsuspected ports. He had twice roamed
through Europe in the guise of an open-mouthed
tourist; had canoed many hundred miles
through the gorges of the Danube to discover,
in little riverside beer-houses, the inward
meanings of secret mobilizations. These were
tasks wholly to his liking.</p>

<p>Therefore he was not unnaturally annoyed
when he was withdrawn from Berlin at a
moment when, as it seemed, the mystery of the
Slovak Treaty was in a way to being solved,
for he had secured, at a cost, a rough but
accurate draft.</p>

<p>“I should have had a photograph of the
actual document if you had left me another
twenty-four hours,” he reproached his chief,
Major George Staines, when he reported himself
at Whitehall next morning.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” replied that unrepentant man,
“but the truth is, we’ve had a heart to heart talk
with the Slovakian Prime Minister, and he has
promised to behave and practically given us the
text of the treaty—it was only a commercial
affair. Mike, did you know Elmer?”</p>

<p>The Foreign Office detective sat down on the
edge of the table.</p>

<p>“Have you brought me from Berlin to ask
me that?” he demanded bitterly. “Have you
taken me from my favourite café on Unter den
Linden—by the way, the Germans are making
small arm ammunition by the million at a converted
pencil factory in Bavaria—to discuss
Elmer? He’s a clerk, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>Major Staines nodded.</p>

<p>“He <em>was</em>,” he said, “in the Accountancy
Department. He disappeared from view three
weeks ago, and an examination of his books
showed that he had been systematically stealing
funds which were under his control.”</p>

<p>Mike Brixan made a little face.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” he said. “He
seemed to be a fairly quiet and inoffensive man.
But surely you don’t want me to go after him?
That is a job for Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to go after him,” said
Staines slowly, “because—well, he has been
found.”</p>

<p>There was something very significant and
sinister in his tone, and before he could take
the little slip of paper from the portfolio on the
desk, Michael Brixan knew what was coming.</p>

<p>“Not the Head-Hunter?” he gasped. Even
Michael knew about the Head-Hunter.</p>

<p>Staines nodded.</p>

<p>“Here’s the note.”</p>

<p>He handed the typewritten slip across to his
subordinate, and Michael read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“You will find a box in the hedge by the
railway arch at Esher.</p>

</p>“The Head-Hunter.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“The Head-Hunter!” repeated Michael
mechanically, and whistled.</p>

<p>“We found the box, and of course we found
the unfortunate Elmer’s head, sliced neatly
from his body,” said Staines. “This is the
twelfth head in seven years,” Staines went on,
“and in almost every case—in fact, in every
case except two—the victim has been a fugitive
from justice. Even if the treaty question had
not been settled, Mike, I should have brought
you back.”</p>

<p>“But this is a police job,” said the young
man, troubled.</p>

<p>“Technically you’re a policeman,” interrupted
his chief, “and the Foreign Secretary
wishes you to take this case in hand, and he
does this with the full approval of the Secretary
of State, who of course controls Scotland Yard.
So far, the death of Francis Elmer and the
discovery of his gruesome remains have not
been given out to the press. There was such a
fuss last time that the police want to keep this
quiet. They have had an inquest—I guess the
jury was picked, but it would be high treason
to say so—and the usual verdict has been
returned. The only information I can give you
is that Elmer was seen by his niece a week ago
in Chichester. We discovered this before the
man’s fate was known. The girl, Adele Leamington,
is working for the Knebworth Film
Corporation, which has its studio in Chichester.
Old Knebworth is an American and a very good
sort. The girl is a sort of super-chorus-extra,
that’s the word——”</p>

<p>Michael gasped.</p>

<p>“Extra! I knew that infernal word would
turn up again. Go on, sir—what do you wish
me to do?”</p>

<p>“Go along and see her,” said the chief.
“Here is the address.”</p>

<p>“Is there a Mrs. Elmer?” asked Michael as
he put the slip into his pocket.</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, but she can throw no light upon the
murder. She, by the way, is the only person
who knows he is dead. She had not seen her
husband for a month, and apparently they had
been more or less separated for years. She
benefits considerably by his death, for he was
well insured in her favour.”</p>

<p>Michael read again the gruesome note from
the Head-Hunter.</p>

<p>“What is your theory about this?” he
asked curiously.</p>

<p>“The general idea is that he is a lunatic
who feels called upon to mete out punishment
to defaulters. But the two exceptions disturb
that theory pretty considerably.”</p>

<p>Staines lay back in his chair, a puzzled
frown on his face.</p>

<p>“Take the case of Willitt. His head was
found on Clapham Common two years ago.
Willitt was a well-off man, the soul of honesty,
well liked, and he had a very big balance at
his bank. Crewling, the second exception,
who was one of the first of the Hunter’s
victims, was also above suspicion, though in
his case there is no doubt he was mentally
unbalanced a few weeks before his death.</p>

<p>“The typewritten notification has invariably
been typed out on the same machine. In
every case you have the half-obliterated ‘u,’ the
faint ‘g,’ and the extraordinary alignment
which the experts are unanimous in ascribing to
a very old and out-of-date Kost machine.
Find the man who uses that typewriter and you
have probably found the murderer. But it is
very unlikely that he will ever be found that
way, for the police have published photographs
pointing out the peculiarities of type, and I
should imagine that Mr. Hunter does not use
this machine except to announce the demise of
his victims.”</p>

<p>Michael Brixan went back to his flat, a little
more puzzled and a little more worried by his
unusual commission. He moved and had his
being in the world of high politics. The
finesses of diplomacy were his peculiar study,
and the normal abnormalities of humanity, the
thefts and murders and larcenies which occupied
the attention of the constabulary, did not come
into his purview.</p>

<p>“Bill,” said he, addressing the small terrier
that lay on the hearth-rug before the fireless
grate of his sitting-room, “this is where I fall
down. But whether I do or not, I’m going to
meet an extra—ain’t that grand?”</p>

<p>Bill wagged his tail agreeably.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MR. SAMPSON LONGVALE CALLS</span></h1></div>

<p>Adele Leamington waited till the studio was
almost empty before she came to where the
white-haired man sat crouched in his canvas
chair, his hands thrust into his trousers pockets,
a malignant scowl on his forehead.</p>

<p>It was not a propitious moment to approach
him: nobody knew that better than she.</p>

<p>“Mr. Knebworth, may I speak to you?”</p>

<p>He looked up slowly. Ordinarily he would
have risen, for this middle-aged American in
normal moments was the soul of courtesy. But
just at that moment, his respect for womanhood
was something below zero. His look was
blank, though the director in him instinctively
approved her values. She was pretty, with
regular features, a mop of brown hair in which
the sunshine of childhood still lingered. Her
mouth firm, delicately shaped, her figure slim—perfect
in many ways.</p>

<p>Jack had seen many beautiful extras in his
career, and had passed through stages of
enthusiasm and despair as he had seen them
translated to the screen—pretty wooden figures
without soul or expression, gauche of movement,
hopeless. Too pretty to be clever, too
conscious of their beauty to be natural. Dolls
without intelligence or initiative—just “extras”
who could wear clothes in a crowd, who could
smile and dance mechanically, fit for extras and
nothing else all the days of their lives.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked brusquely.</p>

<p>“Is there a part I could play in this production,
Mr. Knebworth?” she asked.</p>

<p>His shaven lips curled.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you playing a part, Miss—can’t
remember your name—Leamington, is it?”</p>

<p>“I’m certainly playing—I’m one of the
figures in the background,” she smiled. “I
don’t want a big part, but I’m sure I could do
better than I have done.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty sure you couldn’t do worse than
some people,” he growled. “No, there’s no
part for you, friend. There’ll be no story to
shoot unless things alter. That’s what!”</p>

<p>She was going away when he recalled her.</p>

<p>“Left a good home, I guess?” he said.
“Thought picture-making meant a million
dollars a year an’ a new automobile every
Thursday? Or maybe you were holding
down a good job as a stenographer and got it
under your toque that you’d make Hollywood
feel small if you got your chance? Go back
home, kid, and tell the old man that a typewriter’s
got a sunlight arc beaten to death as an
instrument of commerce.”</p>

<p>The girl smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t come into pictures because I
was stage-struck, if that is what you mean,
Mr. Knebworth. I came in knowing just how
hard a life it might be. I have no parents.”</p>

<p>He looked up at her curiously.</p>

<p>“How do you live?” he asked. “There’s
no money in ‘extra’ work—not on this lot,
anyway. Might be if I was one of those
billion dollar directors who did pictures with
chariot races. But I don’t. My ideal picture
has got five characters.”</p>

<p>“I have a little income from my mother,
and I write,” said the girl.</p>

<p>She stopped as she saw him looking past
her to the studio entrance, and, turning her
head, saw a remarkable figure standing in the
doorway. At first she thought it was an actor
who had made up for a film test.</p>

<p>The newcomer was an old man, but his
great height and erect carriage would not have
conveyed that impression at a distance. The
tight-fitting tail-coat, the trousers strapped
to his boots, the high collar and black satin
stock belonged to a past age, though they were
newly made. The white linen bands that
showed at his wrists were goffered, his double-breasted
waistcoat of grey velvet was fastened
by golden buttons. He might have stepped
from a family portrait of one of those dandies
of the ’fifties. He held a tall hat in one gloved
hand, a hat with a curly brim, and in the
other a gold-topped walking-stick. The face,
deeply lined, was benevolent and kind, and he
seemed unconscious of his complete baldness.</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth was out of his chair in a
second and walked toward the stranger.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Longvale, I am glad to see you—did
you get my letter? I can’t tell you how
much obliged I am to you for the loan of your
house.”</p>

<p>Sampson Longvale, of the Dower House!
She remembered now. He was known in
Chichester as “the old-fashioned gentleman,”
and once, when she was out on location, somebody
had pointed out the big, rambling house,
with its weed-grown garden and crumbling
walls, where he lived.</p>

<p>“I thought I would come over and see you,”
said the big man.</p>

<p>His voice was rich and beautifully modulated.
She did not remember having heard
a voice quite as sweet, and she looked at the
eccentric figure with a new interest.</p>

<p>“I can only hope that the house and grounds
are suitable to your requirements. I am
afraid they are in sad disorder, but I cannot
afford to keep the estate in the same condition
as my grandfather did.”</p>

<p>“Just what I want, Mr. Longvale. I was
afraid you might be offended when I told
you——”</p>

<p>The old gentleman interrupted him with a
soft laugh.</p>

<p>“No, no, I wasn’t offended, I was amused.
You needed a haunted house: I could even
supply that quality, though I will not promise
you that my family ghost will walk. The
Dower House has been haunted for hundreds
of years. A former occupant in a fit of frenzy
murdered his daughter there, and the unhappy
lady is supposed to walk. I have never seen
her, though many years ago one of my servants
did. Fortunately, I am relieved of that form
of annoyance: I no longer keep servants in the
house,” he smiled, “though, if you care to
stay the night, I shall be honoured to
entertain five or six of your company.”</p>

<p>Knebworth heaved a sigh of relief. He had
made diligent inquiries and found that it was
almost impossible to secure lodgings in the
neighbourhood, and he was most anxious to
take night pictures, and for one scene he
particularly desired the peculiar light value
which he could only obtain in the early hours
of the morning.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that would give you a lot of
trouble, Mr. Longvale,” he said. “And here
and now I think we might discuss that delicate
subject of——”</p>

<p>The old man stopped him with a gesture.</p>

<p>“If you are going to speak of money, please
don’t,” he said firmly. “I am interested in
cinematography; in fact, I am interested in
most modern things. We old men are usually
prone to decry modernity, but I find my chiefest
pleasure in the study of those scientific wonders
which this new age has revealed to us.”</p>

<p>He looked at the director quizzically.</p>

<p>“Some day you shall take a picture of me in
the one rôle in which I think I should have
no peer—a picture of me in the rôle of my
illustrious ancestor.”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth stared, half amused, half
startled. It was no unusual experience to
find people who wished to see themselves
on the screen, but he never expected that
little piece of vanity from Mr. Sampson Longvale.</p>

<p>“I should be glad,” he said formally.
“Your people were pretty well known, I
guess?”</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale sighed.</p>

<p>“It is my regret that I do not come from the
direct line that included Charles Henry, the
most historic member of my family. He was
my great-uncle. I come from the Bordeaux
branch of Longvales, which has made history,
sir.” He shook his head regretfully.</p>

<p>“Are you French, Mr. Longvale?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>Apparently the old man did not hear him.
He was staring into space. Then, with a
start:</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, we were French. My great-grandfather
married an English lady whom he
met in peculiar circumstances. We came to
England in the days of the directorate.”</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, he seemed aware of
Adele’s presence, and bowed toward her.</p>

<p>“I think I must go,” he said, taking a huge
gold watch from his fob pocket.</p>

<p>The girl watched them as they passed out
of the hall, and presently she saw the “old-fashioned
gentleman” pass the window, driving
the oldest-fashioned car she had ever seen.
It must have been one of the first motor-cars
ever introduced into the country, a great,
upstanding, cumbersome machine, that passed
with a thunderous sound and at no great speed
down the gravel drive out of sight.</p>

<p>Presently Jack Knebworth came slowly
back.</p>

<p>“This craze for being screened certainly
gets ’em—old or young,” he said. “Good
night, Miss—forget your name—Leamington,
ain’t it? Good night.”</p>

<p>She was half-way home before she realized
that the conversation that she had plucked up
such courage to initiate had ended unsatisfactorily
for her, and she was as far away from
her small part as ever.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch3'>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE NIECE</span></h1></div>

<p>Adele Leamington occupied a small room in
a small house, and there were moments when
she wished it were smaller, that she might be
justified in plucking up her courage to ask
from the stout and unbending Mrs. Watson,
her landlady, a reduction of rent. The extras
on Jack Knebworth’s lot were well paid but
infrequently employed; for Jack was one of
those clever directors who specialized in
domestic stories.</p>

<p>She was dressing when Mrs. Watson brought
in her morning cup of tea.</p>

<p>“There’s a young fellow been hanging round
outside since I got up,” said Mrs. Watson.
“I saw him when I took in the milk. Very
polite he was, but I told him you weren’t
awake.”</p>

<p>“Did he want to see me?” asked the
astonished girl.</p>

<p>“That’s what he said,” said Mrs. Watson
grimly. “I asked him if he came from
Knebworth, and he said no. If you want to
see him, you can have the use of the parlour,
though I don’t like young men calling on young
girls. I’ve never let theatrical lodgings before,
and you can’t be too careful. I’ve always
had a name for respectability and I want to
keep it.”</p>

<p>Adele smiled.</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine anything more respectable
than an early morning caller, Mrs. Watson,”
she said.</p>

<p>She went downstairs and opened the door.
The young man was standing on the side-walk
with his back to her, but at the sound of the
door opening he turned. He was good-looking
and well-dressed, and his smile was quick and
appealing.</p>

<p>“I hope your landlady did not bother to
wake you up? I could have waited. You are
Miss Adele Leamington, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Will you come in, please?” she asked, and
took him into the stuffy little front parlour, and,
closing the door behind her, waited.</p>

<p>“I am a reporter,” he said untruthfully, and
her face fell.</p>

<p>“You’ve come about Uncle Francis? Is
anything really wrong? They sent a detective
to see me a week ago. Have they found him?”</p>

<p>“No, they haven’t found him,” he said
carefully. “You knew him very well, of
course, Miss Leamington?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, I have only seen him twice in my life.
My dear father and he quarrelled before I was
born, and I only saw him once after daddy
died, and once before mother was taken with
her fatal illness.”</p>

<p>She heard him sigh, and sensed his relief,
though why he should be relieved that her
uncle was almost a stranger to her, she could
not fathom.</p>

<p>“You saw him at Chichester, though?” he
said.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him. I was on my way to
Goodwood Park—a whole party of us in a
char-à-banc—and I saw him for a moment
walking along the side-walk. He looked
desperately ill and worried. He was just
coming out of a stationer’s shop when I saw
him; he had a newspaper under his arm and
a letter in his hand.”</p>

<p>“Where was the store?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>She gave him the address, and he jotted it
down.</p>

<p>“You didn’t see him again?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Is anything really very badly wrong?” she
asked anxiously. “I’ve often heard mother
say that Uncle Francis was very extravagant,
and a little unscrupulous. Has he been in
trouble?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Michael, “he has been in
trouble, but nothing that you need worry about.
You’re a great film actress, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>In spite of her anxiety she laughed.</p>

<p>“The only chance I have of being a great
film actress is for you to say so in your paper.”</p>

<p>“My what?” he asked, momentarily puzzled.
“Oh yes, my newspaper, of course!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’re a reporter at all,”
she said with sudden suspicion.</p>

<p>“Indeed I am,” he said glibly, and dared to
pronounce the name of that widely-circulated
sheet upon which the sun seldom sets.</p>

<p>“Though I’m not a great actress, and fear
I never shall be, I like to believe it is because
I’ve never had a chance—I’ve a horrible
suspicion that Mr. Knebworth knows instinctively
that I am no good.”</p>

<p>Mike Brixan had found a new interest in the
case, an interest which, he was honest enough
to confess to himself, was not dissociated from
the niece of Francis Elmer. He had never
met anybody quite so pretty and quite so
unsophisticated and natural.</p>

<p>“You’re going to the studio, I suppose?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Mr. Knebworth would mind
my calling to see you?”</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>“Mr. Knebworth doesn’t like callers.”</p>

<p>“Then maybe I’ll call on him,” said Michael,
nodding. “It doesn’t matter whom I call on,
does it?”</p>

<p>“It certainly doesn’t matter to me,” said the
girl coldly.</p>

<p>“In the vulgar language of the masses,”
thought Mike as he strode down the street, “I
have had the bird!”</p>

<p>His inquiries did not occupy very much of his
time. He found the little news shop, and the
proprietor, by good fortune, remembered the
coming of Mr. Francis Elmer.</p>

<p>“He came for a letter, though it wasn’t
addressed to Elmer,” said the shopkeeper.
“A lot of people have their letters addressed
here. I make a little extra money that way.”</p>

<p>“Did he buy a newspaper?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he did not buy a newspaper;
he had one under his arm—the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Morning
Telegram</i>. I remember that, because I
noticed that he’d put a blue pencil mark
round one of the agony advertisements on the
front page, and I was wondering what it was
all about. I kept a copy of that day’s
<i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Morning Telegram</i>: I’ve got it now.”</p>

<p>He went into the little parlour at the back
of the shop and returned with a dingy newspaper,
which he laid on the counter.</p>

<p>“There are six there, but I don’t know which
one it was.”</p>

<p>Michael examined the agony advertisements.
There was one frantic message from a mother
to her son, asking him to return and saying
that “all would be forgiven.” There was a
cryptogram message, which he had not time to
decipher. A third, which was obviously the
notice of an assignation. The fourth was a
thinly veiled advertisement for a new hair-waver,
and at the fifth he stopped. It ran:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Troubled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Final directions at address I</p>
<p class='line'>gave you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Courage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefactor.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p>“Some ‘benefactor,’ ” said Mike Brixan.
“What was he like—the man who called?
Was he worried?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir: he looked upset—all distracted
like. He seemed like a chap who’d lost his
head.”</p>

<p>“That seems a fair description,” said Mike.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE LEADING LADY</span></h1></div>

<p>In the studio of the Knebworth Picture
Corporation the company had been waiting in
its street clothes for the greater part of an hour.</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth sat in his conventional
attitude, huddled up in his canvas chair,
fingering his long chin and glaring from time
to time at the clock above the studio manager’s
office.</p>

<p>It was eleven when Stella Mendoza flounced
in, bringing with her the fragrance of wood
violets and a small, unhappy Peke.</p>

<p>“Do you work to summer-time?” asked
Knebworth slowly. “Or maybe you thought
the call was for afternoon? You’ve kept fifty
people waiting, Stella.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help their troubles,” she said with
a shrug of shoulder. “You told me you were
going on location, and naturally I didn’t
expect there would be any hurry. I had to
pack my things.”</p>

<p>“Naturally you didn’t think there was any
hurry!”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth reckoned to have three
fights a year. This was the third. The first
had been with Stella, and the second had been
with Stella, and the third was certainly to be
with Stella.</p>

<p>“I wanted you to be here at ten. I’ve had
these boys and girls waiting since a quarter of
ten.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to shoot?” she asked
with an impatient jerk of her head.</p>

<p>“You mostly,” said Jack slowly. “Get into
No. 9 outfit and don’t forget to leave your pearl
ear-rings off. You’re supposed to be a half-starved
chorus girl. We’re shooting at Griff
Towers, and I told the gentleman who lent us
the use of the house that I’d be through the
day work by three. If you were Pauline
Frederick or Norma Talmadge or Lillie Gish,
you’d be worth waiting for, but Stella Mendoza
has got to be on this lot by ten—and don’t
forget it!”</p>

<p>Old Jack Knebworth got up from his canvas
chair and began to put on his coat with
ominous deliberation, the flushed and angry
girl watching him, her dark eyes blazing with
injured pride and hurt vanity.</p>

<p>Stella had once been plain Maggie Stubbs,
the daughter of a Midland grocer, and old
Jack had talked to her as if she were still
Maggie Stubbs and not the great film star of
coruscating brilliance, idol (or her press agent
lied) of the screen fans of all the world.</p>

<p>“All right, if you want a fuss you can have
it, Knebworth. I’m going to quit—now!
I think I know what is due to my position.
That part’s got to be rewritten to give me
a chance of putting my personality over.
There’s too much leading man in it, anyway.
People don’t pay real money to see men.
You don’t treat me fair, Knebworth: I’m
temperamental, I admit it. You can’t expect
a woman of my kind to be a block of wood.”</p>

<p>“The only thing about you that’s a block
of wood is your head, Stella,” grunted the
producer, and went on, oblivious to the rising
fury expressed in the girl’s face. “You’ve had
two years playing small parts in Hollywood,
and you’ve brought nothing back to England
but a line of fresh talk, and you could have
gotten that out of the Sunday supplements!
Temperament! That’s a word that means
doctors’ certificates when a picture’s half taken,
and a long rest unless your salary’s put up fifty
per cent. Thank God this picture isn’t a
quarter taken or an eighth. Quit, you mean-spirited
guttersnipe—and quit as soon as you
darn please!”</p>

<p>Boiling with rage, her lips quivering so that
she could not articulate, the girl turned and
flung out of the studio.</p>

<p>White-haired Jack Knebworth glared round
at the silent company.</p>

<p>“This is where the miracle happens,” he
said sardonically. “This is where the extra
girl who’s left a sick mother and a mortgage at
home leaps to fame in a night. If you don’t
know that kinder thing happens on every lot
in Hollywood you’re no students of fiction.
Stand forth, Mary Pickford the second!”</p>

<p>The extras smiled, some amused, some
uncomfortable, but none spoke. Adele was
frozen stiff, incapable of speech.</p>

<p>“Modesty don’t belong to this industry,”
old Jack sneered amiably. “Who thinks she
can play ‘Roselle’ in this piece—because an
extra’s going to play the part, believe me!
I’m going to show this pseudo-actress that there
isn’t an extra on this lot that couldn’t play her
head off. Somebody talked about playing a
part yesterday—you!”</p>

<p>His forefinger pointed to Adele, and with a
heart that beat tumultuously she went toward
him.</p>

<p>“I had a camera test of you six months ago,”
said Jack suspiciously. “There was something
wrong with her: what was it?”</p>

<p>He turned to his assistant. That young
man scratched his head in an effort of memory.</p>

<p>“Ankles?” he hazarded a guess at random—a
safe guess, for Knebworth had views about
ankles.</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong with them—get out the
print and let us see it.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Adele sat by the old
man’s side in the little projection room and saw
her “test” run through.</p>

<p>“Hair!” said Knebworth triumphantly. “I
knew there was something. Don’t like bobbed
hair. Makes a girl too pert and sophisticated.
You’ve grown it?” he added as the lights were
switched on.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Knebworth.”</p>

<p>He looked at her in dispassionate admiration.</p>

<p>“You’ll do,” he said reluctantly. “See the
wardrobe and get Miss Mendoza’s costumes.
There’s one thing I’d like to tell you before you
go,” he said, stopping her. “You may be
good and you may be bad, but, good or bad,
there’s no future for you—so don’t get heated
up. The only woman who’s got any chance in
England is the producer’s wife, and I’ll never
marry you if you go down on your knees to me!
That’s the only kind of star they know in
English films—the producer’s wife; and unless
you’re that, you haven’t——!”</p>

<p>He snapped his finger.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a word of advice, kid. If you
make good in this picture, link yourself up with
one of those cute English directors that set
three flats and a pot of palms and call it
a drawing-room! Give Miss What’s-her-name
the script, Harry. Say—go out somewhere
quiet and study it, will you? Harry, you see
the wardrobe. I give you half an hour to read
that script!”</p>

<p>Like one in a dream, the girl walked out
into the shady garden that ran the length of
the studio building, and sat down, trying
to concentrate on the typewritten lines. It
wasn’t true—it could not be true! And then
she heard the crunch of feet on gravel and
looked up in alarm. It was the young man
who had seen her that morning—Michael
Brixan.</p>

<p>“Oh, please—you mustn’t interrupt me!”
she begged in agitation. “I’ve got a part—a
big part to read.”</p>

<p>Her distress was so real that he hastened to
take his departure.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry——” he began.</p>

<p>In her confusion she had dropped the loose
sheets of the manuscript, and, stooping with her
to pick them up, their heads bumped.</p>

<p>“Sorry—that’s an old comedy situation, isn’t
it?” he began.</p>

<p>And then he saw the sheet of paper in his
hand and began to read. It was a page of
elaborate description of a scene.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The cell is large, lighted by a swinging
lamp. In centre is a steel gate through which
a soldier on guard is seen pacing to and
fro——”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“Good God!” said Michael, and went
white.</p>

<p>The “u’s” in the type were blurred, the
“g” was indistinct. The page had been
typed on the machine from which the Head-Hunter
sent forth his gruesome tales of death.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch5'>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MR. LAWLEY FOSS</span></h1></div>

<p>“What is wrong?” asked Adele, seeing the
young man’s grave face.</p>

<p>“Where did this come from?”</p>

<p>He showed her the sheet of typewritten
script.</p>

<p>“I don’t know: it was with the other sheets.
I knew, of course, that it didn’t belong to
‘Roselle.’ ”</p>

<p>“Is that the play you’re acting in?” he
asked quickly. And then: “Who would
know?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Knebworth.”</p>

<p>“Where shall I find him?”</p>

<p>“You go through that door,” she said, “and
you will find him on the studio floor.”</p>

<p>Without a word, he walked quickly into the
building. Instinctively he knew which of
the party was the man he sought. Jack
Knebworth looked up under lowering brows at
the sight of the stranger, for he was a stickler
for privacy in business hours; but before he
could demand an explanation, Michael was up
to him.</p>

<p>“Are you Mr. Knebworth?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“I surely am,” he said.</p>

<p>“May I speak to you for two minutes?”</p>

<p>“I can’t speak to anybody for one minute,”
growled Jack. “Who are you, anyway, and
who let you in?”</p>

<p>“I am a detective from the Foreign Office,”
said Michael, lowering his voice, and Jack’s
manner changed.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong?” he asked, as he
accompanied the detective into his sanctum.</p>

<p>Jack laid down the sheet of paper with its
typed characters on the table.</p>

<p>“Who wrote that?” he asked.</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth looked at the manuscript
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen it before. What is it all
about?”</p>

<p>“You’ve never seen this manuscript at all?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll swear to that, but I dare say my
scenario man will know all about it. I’ll send
for him.”</p>

<p>He touched a bell, and, to the clerk who
came:</p>

<p>“Ask Mr. Lawley Foss to come quickly,”
he said.</p>

<p>“The reading of books, plots and material
for picture plays is entirely in the hands of my
scenario manager,” he said. “I never see
a manuscript until he considers it’s worth
producing; and even then, of course, the
picture isn’t always made. If the story
happens to be a bad one, I don’t see it at all.
I’m not so sure that I haven’t lost some good
stories, because Foss”—he hesitated a second—“well,
he and I don’t see exactly eye to
eye. Now, Mr. Brixan, what is the trouble?”</p>

<p>In a few words Michael explained the grave
significance of the typewritten sheet.</p>

<p>“The Head-Hunter!” Jack whistled.</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door, and
Lawley Foss slipped into the room. He was
a thinnish man, dark and saturnine of face,
shifty of eye. His face was heavily lined as
though he suffered from some chronic disease.
But the real disease which preyed on Lawley
Foss was the bitterness of mind that comes to
a man at war with the world. There had been
a time in his early life when he thought that
same world was at his feet. He had written
two plays that had been produced and had run
a few nights. Thereafter, he had trudged
from theatre to theatre in vain, for the
taint of failure was on him, and no manager
would so much as open the brown-covered
manuscripts he brought to them. Like many
another man, he had sought easy ways to
wealth, but the Stock Exchange and the race
track had impoverished him still further.</p>

<p>He glanced suspiciously at Michael as he
entered.</p>

<p>“I want to see you, Foss, about a sheet of
script that’s got amongst the ‘Roselle’ script,”
said Jack Knebworth. “May I tell Mr. Foss
what you have told me?”</p>

<p>Michael hesitated for a second. Some
cautioning voice warned him to keep the
question of the Head-Hunter a secret.
Against his better judgment he nodded.</p>

<p>Lawley Foss listened with an expressionless
face whilst the old director explained the
significance of the interpolated sheet, then he
took the page from Jack Knebworth’s hand
and examined it. Not by a twitch of his face
or a droop of his eyelid did he betray his
thoughts.</p>

<p>“I get a lot of stuff in,” he said, “and I
can’t immediately place this particular play;
but if you’ll let me take it to my office, I will
look up my books.”</p>

<p>Again Michael considered. He did not
wish that piece of evidence to pass out of his
hands; and yet without confirmation and
examination, it was fairly valueless. He
reluctantly agreed.</p>

<p>“What do you make of that fellow?” asked
Jack Knebworth when the door had closed
upon the writer.</p>

<p>“I don’t like him,” said Michael bluntly.
“In fact, my first impressions are distinctly
unfavourable, though I am probably doing the
poor gentleman a very great injustice.”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth sighed. Foss was one of
his biggest troubles, sometimes bulking larger
than the temperamental Mendoza.</p>

<p>“He certainly is a queer chap,” he said,
“though he’s diabolically clever. I never
knew a man who could take a plot and
twist it as Lawley Foss can—but he’s—difficult.”</p>

<p>“I should imagine so,” said Michael dryly.</p>

<p>They passed out into the studio, and
Michael sought the troubled girl to explain his
crudeness. There were tears of vexation in
her eyes when he approached her, for his
startling disappearance with a page of the
script had put all thoughts of the play from
her mind.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he said penitently. “I
almost wish I hadn’t come.”</p>

<p>“And I quite wish it,” she said, smiling in
spite of herself. “What was the matter with
that page you took—you <em>are</em> a detective, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I admit it,” said Michael recklessly.</p>

<p>“Did you speak the truth when you said
that my uncle——” she stopped, at a loss for
words.</p>

<p>“No, I did not,” replied Michael quietly.
“You uncle is dead, Miss Leamington.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” she gasped.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“He was murdered, in extraordinary
circumstances.”</p>

<p>Suddenly her face went white.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t the man whose head was found
at Esher?”</p>

<p>“How did you know?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>“It was in this morning’s newspaper,” she
said, and inwardly he cursed the sleuth-hound
of a reporter who had got on to the track of
this latest tragedy.</p>

<p>She had to know sooner or later: he satisfied
himself with that thought.</p>

<p>The return of Foss relieved him of further
explanations. The man spoke for a while with
Jack Knebworth in a low voice, and then the
director beckoned Michael across.</p>

<p>“Foss can’t trace this manuscript,” he said,
handing back the sheet. “It may have been
a sample page sent in by a contributor, or it
may have been a legacy from our predecessors.
I took over a whole lot of manuscript with
the studio from a bankrupt production
company.”</p>

<p>He looked impatiently at his watch.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Brixan, if it’s possible I should
be glad if you would excuse me. I’ve got
some scenes to shoot ten miles away, with a
leading lady from whose little head you’ve
scared every idea that will be of the slightest
value to me.”</p>

<p>Michael acted upon an impulse.</p>

<p>“Would you mind my coming out with you
to shoot—that means to photograph, doesn’t
it? I promise you I won’t be in the way.”</p>

<p>Old Jack nodded curtly, and ten minutes
later Michael Brixan was sitting side by side
with the girl in a char-à-banc which was carrying
them to the location. That he should be
riding with the artistes at all was a tribute to
his nerve rather than to his modesty.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch6'>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE MASTER OF GRIFF</span></h1></div>

<p>Adele did not speak to him for a long time.
Resentment that he should force his company
upon her, and nervousness at the coming
ordeal—a nervousness which became sheer
panic as they grew nearer and nearer to their
destination—made conversation impossible.</p>

<p>“I see your Mr. Lawley Foss is with us,”
said Michael, glancing over his shoulder, and
by way of making conversation.</p>

<p>“He always goes on location,” she said
shortly. “A story has sometimes to be
amended while it’s being shot.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Griff Towers first,” she replied. She
found it difficult to be uncivil to anybody.
“It is a big place owned by Sir Gregory
Penne.”</p>

<p>“But I thought we were going to the Dower
House?”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a little frown.</p>

<p>“Why did you ask if you knew?” she
demanded, almost in a tone of asperity.</p>

<p>“Because I like to hear you speak,” said
the young man calmly. “Sir Gregory Penne?
I seem to know the name.”</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>“He was in Borneo for many years, wasn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“He’s hateful,” she said vehemently. “I
detest him!”</p>

<p>She did not explain the cause of her
detestation, and Michael thought it discreet
not to press the question, but presently she
relieved him of responsibility.</p>

<p>“I’ve been to his house twice. He has a
very fine garden, which Mr. Knebworth has
used before—of course, I only went as an
extra and was very much in the background.
I wish I had been more so. He has queer
ideas about women, and especially actresses—not
that I’m an actress,” she added hastily,
“but I mean people who play for a living.
Thank heaven there’s only one scene to be
shot at Griff, and perhaps he will not be at
home, but that’s unlikely. He’s always there
when I go.”</p>

<p>Michael glanced at her out of the corner of
his eye. His first impression of her beauty
was more than confirmed. There was a
certain wistfulness in her face which was very
appealing; an honesty in the dark eyes that
told him all he wanted to know about her
attitude toward the admiration of the unknown
Sir Gregory.</p>

<p>“It’s queer how all baronets are villains in
stories,” he said, “and queerer still that most
of the baronets I’ve known have been men of
singular morals. I’m bothering you, being
here, aren’t I?” he asked, dropping his tone
of banter.</p>

<p>She looked round at him.</p>

<p>“You are a little,” she said frankly. “You
see, Mr. Brixan, this is my big chance. It’s
a chance that really never comes to an extra
except in stories, and I’m frightened to death
of what is going to happen. You make me
nervous, but what makes me more panic-stricken
is that the first scene is to be shot at
Griff. I hate it, I hate it!” she said almost
savagely. “That big, hard-looking house,
with its hideous stuffed tigers and its awful
looking swords——”</p>

<p>“Swords?” he asked quickly. “What do
you mean?”</p>

<p>“The walls are covered with them—Eastern
swords. They make me shiver to
see them. But Sir Gregory takes a delight in
them: he told Mr. Knebworth, the last time
we were there, that the swords were as sharp
now as they were when they came from the
hands of their makers, and some of them were
three hundred years old. He’s an extraordinary
man: he can cut an apple in half on
your hand and never so much as scratch you.
That is one of his favourite stunts—do you
know what ‘stunt’ means?”</p>

<p>“I seem to have heard the expression,” said
Michael absently.</p>

<p>“There is the house,” she pointed. “Ugh!
It makes me shiver.”</p>

<p>Griff Towers was one of those bleak looking
buildings that it had been the delight of the
early Victorian architects to erect. Its one
grey tower, placed on the left wing, gave it
a lopsided appearance, but even this distortion
did not distract attention from its rectangular
unloveliness. The place seemed all the more
bare, since the walls were innocent of greenery,
and it stood starkly in the midst of a yellow
expanse of gravel.</p>

<p>“Looks almost like a barracks,” said
Michael, “with a parade ground in front!”</p>

<p>They passed through the lodge gates, and
the char-à-banc stopped half-way up the drive.
The gardens apparently were in the rear of
the building, and certainly there was nothing
that would attract the most careless of
directors in its uninteresting façade.</p>

<p>Michael got down from his seat and found
Jack Knebworth already superintending the
unloading of a camera and reflectors.
Behind the char-à-banc came the big dynamo
lorry, with three sun arcs that were to enhance
the value of daylight.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re here, are you?” growled Jack.
“Now you’ll oblige me, Mr. Brixan, by not
getting in the way? I’ve got a hard morning’s
work ahead of me.”</p>

<p>“I want you to take me on as a—what is
the word?—extra,” said Michael.</p>

<p>The old man frowned at him.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s the great idea?” he asked
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I have an excellent reason, and I promise
you that nothing I do will in any way
embarrass you. The truth is, Mr. Knebworth,
I want to be around for the remainder of the
day, and I need an excuse.”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth bit his lip, scratched his
long chin, scowled, and then:</p>

<p>“All right,” he said gruffly. “Maybe
you’ll come in handy, though I’ll have quite
enough bother directing one amateur, and if
you get into the pictures on this trip you’re
going to be lucky!”</p>

<p>There was a man of the party, a tall young
man whose hair was brushed back from his
forehead, and was so tidy and well arranged
that it seemed as if it had originally been
stuck by glue and varnished over. A tall,
somewhat good-looking boy, who had sat on
Adele’s left throughout the journey and had
not spoken once, he raised his eyebrows at
the appearance of Michael, and, strolling
across to the harassed Knebworth, his hands
in his pockets, he asked with a hurt air:</p>

<p>“I say, Mr. Knebworth, who is this
johnny?”</p>

<p>“Which johnny?” growled old Jack.
“You mean Brixan? He’s an extra.”</p>

<p>“Oh, an extra, is he?” said the young man.
“I say, it’s pretty desperately awful when
extras hobnob with principals! And this
Leamington girl—she’s simply going to mess
up the pictures, she is, by Jove!”</p>

<p>“Is she, by Jove?” snarled Knebworth.
“Now see here, Mr. Connolly, I ain’t so much
in love with your work that I’m willing to
admit in advance that even an extra is going
to mess up this picture.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never played opposite to an extra in
my life, dash it all!”</p>

<p>“Then you must have felt lonely,” grunted
Jack, busy with his unpacking.</p>

<p>“Now, Mendoza is an artiste——” began
the youthful leading man, and Jack Knebworth
straightened his back.</p>

<p>“Get over there till you’re wanted, you!”
he roared. “When I need advice from pretty
boys, I’ll come to you—see? For the moment
you’re <i xml:lang="fr">de trop</i>, which is a French expression
meaning that you’re standing on ground there’s
a better use for.”</p>

<p>The disgruntled Reggie Connolly strolled
away with a shrug of his thin shoulders, which
indicated not only his conviction that the picture
would fail, but that the responsibility was everywhere
but under his hat.</p>

<p>From the big doorway of Griff Towers, Sir
Gregory Penne was watching the assembly of
the company. He was a thick-set man, and the
sun of Borneo and an unrestricted appetite had
dyed his skin a colour which was between purple
and brown. His face was covered with innumerable
ridges, his eyes looked forth upon
the world through two narrow slits. The
rounded feminine chin seemed to be the only
part of his face that sunshine and stronger
stimulants had left in its natural condition.</p>

<p>Michael watched him as he strolled down the
slope to where they were standing, guessing his
identity. He wore a golf suit of a loud check
in which red predominated, and a big cap
of the same material was pulled down over
his eyes. Taking the stub of a cigar from
his teeth, with a quick and characteristic
gesture he wiped his scanty moustache on
his knuckles.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Knebworth,” he called.</p>

<p>His voice was harsh and cruel; a voice that
had never been mellowed by laughter or made
soft by the tendernesses of humanity.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Sir Gregory.”</p>

<p>Old Knebworth disentangled himself from
his company.</p>

<p>“Sorry I’m late.”</p>

<p>“Don’t apologize,” said the other. “Only
I thought you were going to shoot earlier.
Brought my little girl, eh?”</p>

<p>“Your little girl?” Jack looked at him,
frankly nonplussed. “You mean Mendoza?
No, she’s not coming.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean Mendoza, if that’s the dark
girl. Never mind: I was only joking.”</p>

<p>Who the blazes was his little girl, thought
Jack, who was ignorant of two unhappy experiences
which an unconsidered extra girl had had
on previous visits. The mystery, however,
was soon cleared up, for the baronet walked
slowly to where Adele Leamington was making
a pretence of studying her script.</p>

<p>“Good morning, little lady,” he said,
lifting his cap an eighth of an inch from his
head.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Sir Gregory,” she said
coldly.</p>

<p>“You didn’t keep your promise.” He shook
his head waggishly. “Oh, woman, woman!”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember having made a promise,”
said the girl quietly. “You asked me to come
to dinner with you, and I told you that that was
impossible.”</p>

<p>“I promised to send my car for you. Don’t
say it was too far away. Never mind, never
mind.” And, to Michael’s wrath, he squeezed
the girl’s arm in a manner which was intended
to be paternal, but which filled the girl with
indignant loathing.</p>

<p>She wrenched her arm free, and, turning her
back upon her tormentor, almost flew to Jack
Knebworth with an incoherent demand for
information on the reading of a line which was
perfectly simple.</p>

<p>Old Jack was no fool. He watched the play
from under his eyelids, recognizing all the
symptoms.</p>

<p>“This is the last time we shall shoot at Griff
Towers,” he told himself.</p>

<p>For Jack Knebworth was something of a
stickler on behaviour, and had views on women
which were diametrically opposite to those held
by Sir Gregory Penne.</p>

<p>The little party moved away, leaving Michael
alone with the baronet. For a period, Gregory
Penne watched the girl, his eyes glittering;
then he became aware of Michael’s presence and
turned a cold, insolent stare upon the other.</p>

<p>“What are you?” he asked, looking the
detective up and down.</p>

<p>“I’m an extra,” said Michael.</p>

<p>“An extra, eh? Sort of chorus boy? Put
paint and powder on your face and all that sort
of thing? What a life for a man!”</p>

<p>“There are worse,” said Michael, holding
his antagonism in check.</p>

<p>“Do you know that little girl—what’s her
name, Leamington?” asked the baronet
suddenly.</p>

<p>“I know her extremely well,” said Michael
untruthfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, you do, eh?” said the master of Griff
Towers with sudden amiability. “She’s a nice
little thing. Quite a cut above the ordinary
chorus girl. You might bring her along to
dinner one night. She’d come with you,
eh?”</p>

<p>The contortions of the puffy eyelids suggested
to Michael that the man had winked. There
was something about this gross figure that
interested the scientist in Michael Brixan. He
was elemental; an animal invested with a brain;
and yet he must be something more than that
if he had held a high administrative position
under Government.</p>

<p>“Are you acting? If you’re not, you can
come up and have a look at my swords,” said
the man suddenly.</p>

<p>Michael guessed that, for a reason of his
own, probably because of his claim to be
Adele’s friend, the man wished to cultivate the
acquaintance.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not acting,” replied Michael.</p>

<p>And no invitation could have given him
greater pleasure. Did their owner realize the
fact, Michael Brixan had already made up his
mind not to leave Griff Towers until he had
inspected that peculiar collection.</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s a nice little girl.”</p>

<p>Penne returned to the subject immediately as
they paced up the slope toward the house.</p>

<p>“As I say, a cut above chorus girls. Young,
unsophisticated, virginal! You can have your
sophisticated girls: there is no mystery to ’em!
They revolt me. A girl should be like a spring
flower. Give me the violet and the snowdrop:
you can have a bushel of cabbage roses for one
petal of the shy dears of the forest.”</p>

<p>Michael listened with a keen sense of nausea,
and yet with an unusual interest, as the man
rambled on. He said things which were
sickening, monstrous. There were moments
when Brixan found it difficult to keep his hands
off the obscene figure that paced at his side;
and only by adopting toward him the attitude
with which the enthusiastic naturalist employs
in his dealings with snakes, was he able to get
a grip of himself.</p>

<p>The big entrance hall into which he was
ushered was paved with earthen tiles, and, looking
up at the stone walls, Michael had his first
glimpse of the famous swords.</p>

<p>There were hundreds of them—poniards,
scimitars, ancient swords of Japan, basket-hilted
hangers, two-handed swords that had
felt the grip of long-dead Crusaders.</p>

<p>“What do you think of ’em, eh?” Sir
Gregory Penne spoke with the pride of an
enthusiastic collector. “There isn’t one of
them that could be duplicated, my boy; and
they’re only the rag, tag and bobtail of my
collection.”</p>

<p>He led his visitor along a broad corridor,
lighted by square windows set at intervals, and
here again the walls were covered with shining
weapons. Throwing open a door, Sir Gregory
ushered the other into a large room which was
evidently his library, though the books were
few, and, so far as Michael could see at
first glance, the conventional volumes that
are to be found in the houses of the country
gentry.</p>

<p>Over the mantelshelf were two great swords
of a pattern which Michael did not remember
having seen before.</p>

<p>“What do you think of those?”</p>

<p>Penne lifted one from the silver hook which
supported it, and drew it from its scabbard.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel the edge unless you want to cut
yourself. This would split a hair, but it would
also cut you in two, and you would never know
what had happened till you fell apart!”</p>

<p>Suddenly his manner changed, and he almost
snatched the sword from Michael’s hand,
and, putting it back in its sheath, he hung
it up.</p>

<p>“That is a Sumatran sword, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It comes from Borneo,” said the baronet
shortly.</p>

<p>“The home of the head-hunters.”</p>

<p>Sir Gregory looked round, his brows lowered.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “it comes from Dutch
Borneo.”</p>

<p>Evidently there was something about this
weapon which aroused unpleasant memories.
He glowered for a long time in silence into the
little fire that was burning on the hearth.</p>

<p>“I killed the man who owned that,” he said
at last, and it struck Michael that he was speaking
more to himself than to his visitor. “At
least, I hope I killed him. I hope so!”</p>

<p>He glanced round, and Michael Brixan
could have sworn there was apprehension in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Sit down, What’s-your-name,” he commanded,
pointing to a low settee. “We’ll have
a drink.”</p>

<p>He pushed a bell, and, to Michael’s astonishment,
the summons was answered by an under-sized
native, a little copper-coloured man, naked
to the waist. Gregory gave an order in a
language which was unintelligible to Michael—he
guessed, by its sibilants, it was Malayan—and
the servant, with a quick salaam, disappeared,
and came back almost instantly with
a tray containing a large decanter and two thin
glasses.</p>

<p>“I have no white servants—can’t stand ’em,”
said Penne, taking the contents of his glass at
a gulp. “I like servants who don’t steal and
don’t gossip. You can lick ’em if they misbehave,
and there’s no trouble. I got this
fellow last year in Sumatra, and he’s the best
butler I’ve had.”</p>

<p>“Do you go to Borneo every year?” asked
Michael.</p>

<p>“I go almost every year,” said the other.
“I’ve got a yacht: she’s lying at Southampton
now. If I didn’t get out of this cursed country
once a year, I’d go mad. There’s nothing here,
nothing! Have you ever met that dithering
old fool, Longvale? Knebworth said you were
going on to him—pompous old ass, who lives
in the past and dresses like an advertisement
for somebody’s whisky. Have another?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t finished this yet,” said Michael
with a smile, and his eyes went up to the sword
above the mantelpiece. “Have you had that
very long? It looks modern.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t,” snapped the other. “Modern!
It’s three hundred years old if it’s a day. I’ve
only had it a year.” Again he changed the
subject abruptly. “I like you, What’s-your-name.
I like people or I dislike them instantly.
You’re the sort of fellow who’d do well in the
East. I’ve made two millions there. The
East is full of wonder, full of unbelievable
things.” He screwed his head round and fixed
Michael with a glittering eye. “Full of good
servants,” he said slowly. “Would you like to
meet the perfect servant?”</p>

<p>There was something peculiar in his tone, and
Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the slave who never
asks questions and never disobeys, who has no
love but love of me”—he thumped himself on
the chest—“no hate but for the people I hate—my
trusty—Bhag?”</p>

<p>He rose, and, crossing to his table, turned a
little switch that Michael had noticed attached
to the side of the desk. As he did so, a part of
the panelled wall at the farther end of the room
swung open. For a second Michael saw nothing,
and then there emerged, blinking into the
daylight, a most sinister, a most terrifying
figure. And Michael Brixan had need for all
his self-control to check the exclamation that
rose to his lips.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch8'>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BHAG</span></h1></div>

<p>It was a great orang-outang. Crouched as it
was, gazing malignantly upon the visitor with
its bead-like eyes, it stood over six feet in
height. The hairy chest was enormous; the
arms that almost touched the floor were as thick
as an average man’s thigh. It wore, a pair of
workman’s dark blue overalls, held in place by
two straps that crossed the broad shoulders.</p>

<p>“Bhag!” called Sir Gregory in a voice so
soft that Michael could not believe it was the
man’s own. “Come here.”</p>

<p>The gigantic figure waddled across the room
to where they stood before the fireplace.</p>

<p>“This is a friend of mine, Bhag.”</p>

<p>The great ape held out his hand, and for a
second Michael’s was held in its velvet palm.
This done, he lifted his paw to his nose and
sniffed loudly, the only sound he made.</p>

<p>“Get me some cigars,” said Penne.</p>

<p>Immediately the ape walked to a cabinet,
pulled open a drawer, and brought out a box.</p>

<p>“Not those,” said Gregory. “The small
ones.”</p>

<p>He spoke distinctly, as if he were articulating
to somebody who was deaf, and, without a
moment’s hesitation, the hideous Bhag replaced
the box and brought out another.</p>

<p>“Pour me out a whisky and soda.”</p>

<p>The ape obeyed. He did not spill a drop,
and when his owner said “Enough,” replaced
the stopper in the decanter and put it back.</p>

<p>“Thank you, that will do, Bhag.”</p>

<p>Without a sound the ape waddled back to the
open panelling and disappeared, and the door
closed behind him.</p>

<p>“Why, the thing is human,” said Michael in
an awe-stricken whisper.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory Penne chuckled.</p>

<p>“More than human,” he said. “Bhag is my
shield against all trouble.”</p>

<p>His eyes seemed to go instantly to the sword
above the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>“Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“He’s got a little apartment of his own, and
he keeps it clean. He feeds with the servants.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” gasped Michael, and the
other chuckled again at the surprise he had
aroused.</p>

<p>“Yes, he feeds with the servants. They’re
afraid of him, but they worship him: he’s a
sort of god to them, but they’re afraid of him.
Do you know what would have happened if I’d
said ‘This man is my enemy?’ ” He pointed
his stubby finger at Michael’s chest. “He
would have torn you limb from limb. You
wouldn’t have had a chance, Mr. What’s-your-name,
not a dog’s chance. And yet he can be
gentle—yes, he can be gentle.” He nodded.
“And cunning! He goes out almost every
night, and I’ve had no complaints from the
villagers. No sheep stolen, nobody frightened.
He just goes out and loafs around in the woods,
and doesn’t kill as much as a hen partridge.”</p>

<p>“How long have you had him?”</p>

<p>“Eight or nine years,” said the baronet
carelessly, swallowing the whisky that the ape
had poured for him. “Now let’s go out and
see the actors and actresses. She’s a nice girl,
eh? You’re not forgetting you’re going to
bring her to dinner, are you? What is your
name?”</p>

<p>“Brixan,” said Michael. “Michael Brixan.”</p>

<p>Sir Gregory grunted something.</p>

<p>“I’ll remember that—Brixan. I ought to
have told Bhag. He likes to know.”</p>

<p>“Would he have known me again, suppose
you had?” asked Michael, smiling.</p>

<p>“Known you?” said the baronet contemptuously.
“He will not only know you, but he’ll
be able to trail you down. Notice him smelling
his hand? He was filing you for reference, my
boy. If I told him ‘Go along and take this
message to Brixan,’ he’d find you.”</p>

<p>When they reached the lovely gardens at the
back of the house, the first scene had been shot,
and there was a smile on Jack Knebworth’s face
which suggested that Adele’s misgivings had
not been justified. And so it proved.</p>

<p>“That girl’s a peach,” Jack unbent to say.
“A natural born actress, built for this scene—it’s
almost too good to be true. What do you
want?”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Reggie Connolly, and he had the
obsession which is perpetual in every leading
man. He felt that sufficient opportunities had
not been offered to him.</p>

<p>“I say, Mr. Knebworth,” he said in a grieved
tone, “I’m not getting much of the fat in this
story! So far, there’s about thirty feet of me
in this picture. I say, that’s not right, you
know! If a johnny is being featured——”</p>

<p>“You’re not being featured,” said Jack
shortly. “And Mendoza’s chief complaint was
that there was too much of you in it.”</p>

<p>Michael looked round. Sir Gregory Penne
had strolled toward where the girl was standing,
and, in her state of elation, she had no
room in her heart even for resentment against
the man she so cordially detested.</p>

<p>“Little girl, I want to speak to you before
you go,” he said, dropping his voice, and for
once she smiled at him.</p>

<p>“Well, you have a good opportunity now,
Sir Gregory,” she said.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you how sorry I am for what
happened the other day, and I respect you for
what you said, for a girl’s entitled to keep
her kisses for men she likes. Aren’t I
right?”</p>

<p>“Of course you’re right,” she said. “Please
don’t think any more about it, Sir Gregory.”</p>

<p>“I’d no right to kiss you against your will,
especially when you’re in my house. Are you
going to forgive me?”</p>

<p>“I do forgive you,” she said, and would have
left him, but he caught her arm.</p>

<p>“You’re coming to dinner, aren’t you?” He
jerked his head toward the watchful Michael.
“Your friend said he’d bring you along.”</p>

<p>“Which friend?” she asked, her eyebrows
raised. “You mean Mr. Brixan?”</p>

<p>“That’s the fellow. Why do you make
friends with that kind of man? Not that he
isn’t a decent fellow. I like him personally.
Will you come along to dinner?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t,” she said, her old
aversion gaining ground.</p>

<p>“Little girl,” he said earnestly, “there’s
nothing you couldn’t have from me. Why do
you want to trouble your pretty head about this
cheap play acting? I’ll give you a company of
your own if you want it, and the best car that
money can buy.”</p>

<p>His eyes were like points of fire, and she
shivered.</p>

<p>“I have all I want, Sir Gregory,” she said.</p>

<p>She was furious with Michael Brixan. How
dared he presume to accept an invitation on her
behalf? How dare he call himself her friend?
Her anger almost smothered her dislike for her
persecutor.</p>

<p>“You come over to-night—let him bring
you,” said Penne huskily. “I want you to-night—do
you hear? You’re staying at old
Longvale’s. You can easily slip out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do nothing of the kind. I don’t think
you know what you’re asking, Sir Gregory,”
she said quietly. “Whatever you mean, it is
an insult to me.”</p>

<p>Turning abruptly, she left him. Michael
would have spoken to her, but she passed, her
head in the air, a look on her face which dismayed
him, though, after a moment’s consideration,
he could guess the cause.</p>

<p>When the various apparatus was packed, and
the company had taken their seats in the
char-à-banc, Michael observed that she had very
carefully placed herself between Jack Knebworth
and the sulking leading man, and wisely
himself chose a seat some distance from her.</p>

<p>The car was about to start when Sir Gregory
came up to him, and, stepping on the running-board:</p>

<p>“You said you’d get her over——” he began.</p>

<p>“If I said that,” said Michael, “I must have
been drunk, and it takes more than one glass
of whisky to reduce me to that disgusting condition.
Miss Leamington is a free agent, and
she would be singularly ill-advised to dine alone
with you or any other man.”</p>

<p>He expected an angry outburst, but, to his
surprise, the squat man only laughed and waved
him a pleasant farewell. Looking round as
the car turned from the lodge gates, Michael
saw him standing on the lawn, talking to a
man, and recognized Foss, who, for some
reason, had stayed behind.</p>

<p>And then his eyes strayed past the two men
to the window of the library, where the
monstrous Bhag sat in his darkened room,
waiting for instructions which he would carry
into effect without reason or pity. Michael
Brixan, hardened as he was to danger of every
variety, found himself shuddering.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ANCESTOR</span></h1></div>

<p>The Dower House was away from the main
road. A sprawling mass of low buildings, it
stood behind untidy hedges and crumbling
walls. Once the place had enjoyed the services
of a lodge-keeper, but the tiny lodge was
deserted, the windows broken, and there were
gaps in the tiled roof. The gates had not been
closed for generations; they were broken, and
leant crazily against the walls to which they
had been thrust by the last person who had
employed them to guard the entrance to the
Dower House.</p>

<p>What had once been a fair lawn was now a
tangle of weeds. Thistle and mayweed grew
knee-deep where the gallants of old had played
their bowls; and it was clear to Michael, from
his one glance, that only a portion of the house
was used. In only one of the wings were the
windows whole; the others were broken or so
grimed with dirt, that they appeared to have
been painted.</p>

<p>His amusement blended with curiosity,
Michael saw for the first time the picturesque
Mr. Sampson Longvale. He came out to meet
them, his bald head glistening in the afternoon
sunlight, his strapped fawn-coloured trousers,
velvet waistcoat and old-fashioned stock completely
supporting Gregory Penne’s description
of him.</p>

<p>“Delighted to see you, Mr. Knebworth.
I’ve a very poor house, but I offer you a very
rich welcome! I have had tea served in my
little dining-room. Will you please introduce
me to the members of your company?”</p>

<p>The courtesy, the old-world spirit of dignity,
were very charming, and Michael felt a warm
glow toward this fine old man who brought to
this modern atmosphere the love and the
fragrance of a past age.</p>

<p>“I should like to shoot a scene before we
lose the light, Mr. Longvale,” said Knebworth,
“so, if you don’t mind the meal being
a scrambling one, I can give the company a
quarter of an hour.” He looked round.
“Where is Foss?” he asked. “I want to
change a scene.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Foss said he was walking from Griff
Towers,” said one of the company. “He
stopped behind to speak to Sir Gregory.”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth cursed his dilatory scenario
man with vigour and originality.</p>

<p>“I hope he hasn’t stopped to borrow money,”
he said savagely. “That fellow’s going to ruin
my credit if I’m not careful.”</p>

<p>He had overcome his objection to his new
extra; possibly he felt that there was nobody
else in the party whom he could take into his
confidence without hurt to discipline.</p>

<p>“Is he that way inclined?”</p>

<p>“He’s always short of money and always
trying to make it by some fool trick which
leaves him shorter than he was before. When
a man gets that kind of bug in his head he’s
only a block away from prison. Are you going
to stay the night? I don’t think you’ll be able
to sleep here,” he said, changing the subject,
“but I suppose you’ll be going back to
London?”</p>

<p>“Not to-night,” said Michael quickly.
“Don’t worry about me. I particularly do not
wish to give you any trouble.”</p>

<p>“Come and meet the old man,” said Knebworth
under his breath. “He’s a queer old
devil with the heart of a child.”</p>

<p>“I like what I’ve seen of him,” said Michael.</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale accepted the introduction all
over again.</p>

<p>“I fear there will not be sufficient room in
my dining-room for the whole company. I have
had a little table laid in my study. Perhaps
you and your friends would like to have your
tea there?”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s very kind of you, Mr. Longvale.
You have met Mr. Brixan?”</p>

<p>The old man smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>“I have met him without realizing that I’ve
met him. I never remember names—a curious
failing which was shared by my great-great-uncle
Charles, with the result that he fell into
extraordinary confusion when he wrote his
memoirs, and in consequence many of the
incidents he relates have been regarded as
apocryphal.”</p>

<p>He showed them into a narrow room that
ran from the front to the back of the house. Its
ceilings were supported by black rafters; the
open wainscoting, polished and worn by generations
of hands, must have been at least five
hundred years old. There were no swords over
this mantelpiece, thought Michael with an
inward smile. Instead, there was a portrait of
a handsome old gentleman, the dignity of
whose face was arresting. There was only one
word with an adequate description: it was
majestic.</p>

<p>He made no comment on the picture, nor
did the old man speak of it till later. The meal
was hastily disposed of, and, sitting on the
wall, Michael watched the last daylight scene
shot, and was struck by the plastic genius of
the girl. He knew enough of motion pictures
and their construction to realize what it meant
to the director to have in his hands one who
could so faithfully reproduce the movements
and the emotions which the old man dictated.</p>

<p>In other circumstances he might have thought
it grotesque to see Jack Knebworth pretending
to be a young girl, resting his elderly cheek
coyly upon the back of his clasped hand, and
walking with mincing steps from one side of
the picture to the other. But he knew that the
American was a mason who was cutting roughly
the shape of the sculpture and leaving it to the
finer artiste to express in her personality the
delicate contours that would delight the eye
of the picture-loving world. She was no longer
Adele Leamington; she was Roselle, the
heiress to an estate of which her wicked cousin
was trying to deprive her. The story itself he
recognized; a half-and-half plagiarism of “The
Cat and the Canary,” with which were blended
certain situations from “The Miracle Man.”
He mentioned this fact when the scene was
finished.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s a steal,” said Jack Knebworth
philosophically, “and I didn’t inquire too
closely into it. It’s Foss’s story, and I should
be pained to discover there was anything
original in it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Foss had made a tardy reappearance,
and Michael found himself wondering what was
the nature of that confidential interview which
the writer had had with Sir Gregory.</p>

<p>Going back to the long sitting-room, he stood
watching the daylight fade and speculating
upon the one mystery within a mystery—the
extraordinary effect which Adele had produced
upon him.</p>

<p>Mike Brixan had known many beautiful
women, women in every class of society. He
had known the best and the worst, he had jailed
a few, and had watched one face a French
firing squad one grey wintry morning at
Vincennes. He had liked many, nearly loved
one, and it seemed, cold-bloodedly analysing
his emotions, that he was in danger of actually
loving a girl whom he had never met before
that morning.</p>

<p>“Which is absurd,” he said aloud.</p>

<p>“What is absurd?” asked Knebworth, who
had come into the room unnoticed.</p>

<p>“I also wondered what you were thinking,”
smiled old Mr. Longvale, who had been watching
the young man in silence.</p>

<p>“I—er—well, I was thinking of the portrait.”
Michael turned and indicated the picture above
the fireplace, and in a sense he spoke the truth,
for the thread of that thought had run through
all others. “The face seemed familiar,” he
said, “which is absurd, because it is obviously
an old painting.”</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale lit two candles and carried
one to the portrait. Again Michael looked,
and again the majesty of the face impressed
him.</p>

<p>“That is my great-great-uncle, Charles
Henry,” said old Mr. Longvale with pride.
“Or, as we call him affectionately in our family,
the Great Monsieur.”</p>

<p>Michael’s face was half-turned toward the
window as the old man spoke.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Suddenly
the room seemed to spin before his eyes. Jack
Knebworth saw his face go white and caught
him by the arm.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Michael unsteadily.</p>

<p>Knebworth was staring past him at the
window.</p>

<p>“What was that?” he said.</p>

<p>With the exception of the illumination from
the two candles and the faint dusk light that
came from the garden, the room was in darkness.</p>

<p>“Did you see it?” he asked, and ran to the
window, staring out.</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked old Mr. Longvale,
joining him.</p>

<p>“I could have sworn I saw a head in the
window. Did you see it, Brixan?”</p>

<p>“I saw something,” said Michael unsteadily.
“Do you mind if I go out into the garden?”</p>

<p>“I hoped you saw it. It looked like a
monkey’s head to me.”</p>

<p>Michael nodded. He walked down the
flagged passage into the garden, and, as he
did so, slipped a Browning from his hip, pressed
down the safety-catch, and dropped the pistol
into his jacket pocket.</p>

<p>He disappeared, and five minutes later Knebworth
saw him pacing the garden path, and
went out to him.</p>

<p>“Did you see anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing in the garden. You must have
been mistaken.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you see him?”</p>

<p>Michael hesitated.</p>

<p>“I thought I saw something,” he said with
an assumption of carelessness. “When are
you going to shoot those night pictures of
yours?”</p>

<p>“You saw something, Brixan—was it a
face?”</p>

<p>Mike Brixan nodded.</p>

<p>The dynamo wagon was humming as he walked
down the garden path, and with a hiss and a
splutter from the arcs, the front of the cottage
was suddenly illuminated by their fierce light.
Outside on the road a motorist had pulled up
to look upon the unusual spectacle.</p>

<p>“What is happening?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p>“They’re taking a picture,” said Michael.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that what it is? I suppose it is one
of Knebworth’s outfits?”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” demanded Michael
suddenly. “Forgive my asking you, but if
you’re heading for Chichester you can render
me a very great service if you give me a lift.”</p>

<p>“Jump in,” said the man. “I’m going to
Petworth, but it will not be much out of my way
to take you into the city.”</p>

<p>Until they came to the town he plied Michael
with questions betraying that universal inquisitiveness
which picture-making invariably
incites amongst the uninitiated.</p>

<p>Michael got down near the market-place and
made his way to the house of a man he knew,
a former master at his old school, now settled
down in Chichester, who had, amongst other
possessions, an excellent library. Declining
his host’s pressing invitation to dinner, Michael
stated his needs, and the old master laughed.</p>

<p>“I can’t remember that you were much of a
student in my days, Michael,” he said, “but
you may have the run of the library. Is it some
line of Virgil that escapes you? I may be able
to save you a hunt.”</p>

<p>“It’s not Virgil, maestro,” smiled Michael.
“Something infinitely more full-blooded!”</p>

<p>He was in the library for twenty minutes, and
when he emerged there was a light of triumph
in his eye.</p>

<p>“I’m going to use your telephone if I may,”
he said, and he got London without delay.</p>

<p>For ten minutes he was speaking with
Scotland Yard, and, when he had finished, he
went into the dining-room where the master,
who was a bachelor, was eating his solitary
dinner.</p>

<p>“You can render me one more service,
mentor of my youth,” he said. “Have you in
this abode of peace an automatic pistol that
throws a heavier shell than this?”</p>

<p>And he put his own on the table. Michael
knew Mr. Scott had been an officer of the
Territorial Army, and incidentally an instructor
of the Officers’ Training Corps, so that his
request was not as impossible of fulfilment as
it appeared.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can give you a heavier one than that.
What are you shooting—elephants?”</p>

<p>“Something a trifle more dangerous,” said
Michael.</p>

<p>“Curiosity was never a weakness of mine,”
said the master, and went out to return with
a Browning of heavy calibre and a box of
cartridges.</p>

<p>They spent five minutes cleaning the pistol,
which had not been in use for some time, and,
with his new weapon weighing down his jacket
pocket, Mike took his leave, carrying a lighter
heart and a clearer understanding than he had
enjoyed when he had arrived at the house.</p>

<p>He hired a car from a local garage and drove
back to the Dower House, dismissing the car
just short of his destination. Jack Knebworth
had not even noticed that he had disappeared.
But old Mr. Longvale, wearing a coat with many
capes, and a soft silk cap from which dangled
a long tassel, came to him almost as soon as
he entered the garden.</p>

<p>“May I speak to you, Mr. Brixan?” he said
in a low voice, and they went into the house
together. “Do you remember Mr. Knebworth
was very perturbed because he thought he saw
somebody peering in at the window—something
with a monkey’s head?”</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, it is a most curious fact,” said the
old gentleman impressively, “that a quarter of
an hour ago I happened to be walking in the
far end of my garden, and, looking across the
hedge toward the field, I suddenly saw a
gigantic form rise, apparently from the ground,
and move toward these bushes”—he pointed
through the window to a clump in a field on
the opposite side of the road. “He seemed to
be crouching forward and moving furtively.”</p>

<p>“Will you show me the place?” said Michael
quickly.</p>

<p>He followed the other across the road to the
bushes, a little clump which was empty when
they reached it. Kneeling down to make a
new skyline, Michael scanned the limited
horizon, but there was no sign of Bhag. For
that it was Bhag he had no doubt. There
might be nothing in it. Penne told him that
the animal was in the habit of taking nightly
strolls, and that he was perfectly harmless.
Suppose .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The thought was absurd, fantastically absurd.
And yet the animal had been so extraordinarily
human that no speculation in connection with
it was quite absurd.</p>

<p>When he returned to the garden, he went in
search of the girl. She had finished her scene
and was watching the stealthy movements of
two screen burglars, who were creeping along
the wall in the subdued light of the arcs.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss Leamington, I’m going
to ask you an impertinent question. Have you
brought a complete change of clothes with
you?”</p>

<p>“Why ever do you ask that?” she demanded,
her eyes wide open. “Of course I did! I
always bring a complete change in case the
weather breaks.”</p>

<p>“That’s one question. Did you lose anything
when you were at Griff Towers?”</p>

<p>“I lost my gloves,” she said quickly. “Did
you find them?”</p>

<p>“No. When did you miss them?”</p>

<p>“I missed them immediately. I thought for
a moment——” She stopped. “It was a
foolish idea, but——”</p>

<p>“What did you think?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not tell you. It is a purely
personal matter.”</p>

<p>“You thought that Sir Gregory had taken
them as a souvenir?”</p>

<p>Even in the half-darkness he saw her colour
come and go.</p>

<p>“I did think that,” she said, a little stiffly.</p>

<p>“Then it doesn’t matter very much—about
your change of clothing,” he said.</p>

<p>“Whatever are you talking about?”</p>

<p>She looked at him suspiciously. He
guessed she thought that he had been drinking,
but the last thing in the world he wanted to do
at that moment was to explain his somewhat
disjointed questions.</p>

<p>“Now everybody is going to bed!”</p>

<p>It was old Jack Knebworth talking.</p>

<p>“Everybody! Off you go! Mr. Foss has
shown you your rooms. I want you up at
four o’clock to-morrow morning, so get as
much sleep as you can. Foss, you’ve marked
the rooms?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the man. “I’ve put the
names on every door. I’ve given this young
lady a room to herself—is that right?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is,” said Knebworth
dubiously. “Anyway, she won’t be there
long enough to get used to it.”</p>

<p>The girl said good night to the detective
and went straight up to her apartment. It
was a tiny room, smelling somewhat musty,
and was simply furnished. A truckle bed, a
chest of drawers with a swinging glass on top,
and a small table and chair was all that the
apartment contained. By the light of her
candle, the floor showed signs of having been
recently scrubbed, and the centre was covered
by a threadbare square of carpet.</p>

<p>She locked the door, blew out the candle
and, undressing in the dark, went to the
window and threw open the casement. And
then, for the first time, she saw, on the centre
of one of the small panes, a circular disc of
paper. It was pasted on the outside of the
window, and at first she was about to pull it
off, when she guessed that it might be some
indicator placed by Knebworth to mark an
exact position that he required for the morning
picture-taking.</p>

<p>She did not immediately fall asleep, her
mind for some curious reason, being occupied
unprofitably with a tumultuous sense of
annoyance directed towards Michael Brixan.
For a long time a strong sense of justice fought
with a sense of humour equally powerful. He
was a nice man, she told herself; the sixth
sense of woman had already delivered that
information, heavily underlined. He certainly
had nerve. In the end humour brought sleep.
She was smiling when her eyelids closed.</p>

<p>She had been sleeping two hours, though it
did not seem two seconds. A sense of impending
danger wakened her, and she sat up in bed,
her heart thumping wildly. She looked round
the room. In the pale moonlight she could
see almost every corner, and it was empty.
Was it somebody outside the door that had
wakened her? She tried the door handle: it
was locked, as she had left it. The window?
It was very near to the ground, she
remembered. Stepping to the window, she
pulled one casement close. She was closing
the other when, out of the darkness below,
reached a great hairy arm and a hand closed
like a vice on her wrist.</p>

<p>She did not scream. She stood breathless,
dying of terror, she felt. Her heart ceased
beating, and she was conscious of a deadly
cold. What was it? What could it be?
Summoning all her courage, she looked out
of the window down into a hideous, bestial
face and two round, green eyes that stared
into hers.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch11'>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE MARK ON THE WINDOW</span></h1></div>

<p>The Thing was twittering at her, soft, bird-like
noises, and she saw the flash of its white
teeth in the darkness. It was not pulling, it
was simply holding, one hand gripping the
tendrils of the ivy up which it had climbed,
the other hand firmly about her wrist. Again
it twittered and pulled. She drew back, but
she might as well have tried to draw back
from a moving piston rod. A great, hairy
leg was suddenly flung over the sill; the
second hand came up and covered her face.</p>

<p>The sound of her scream was deadened in
the hairy paw, but somebody heard it. From
the ground below came a flash of fire and the
deafening ‘tang!’ of a pistol exploding. A
bullet zipped and crashed amongst the ivy,
striking the brickwork, and she heard the
whirr of the ricochet. Instantly the great
monkey released his hold and dropped down
out of sight. Half swooning, she dropped
upon the window-sill, incapable of movement.
And then she saw a figure come out of the
shadow of the laurel bush, and instantly
recognized the midnight prowler. It was
Michael Brixan.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>She could only shake her head, for speech
was denied her.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hit him, did I?”</p>

<p>With an effort she found a husk of a voice
in her dry throat.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so. He dropped.”</p>

<p>Michael had pulled an electric torch from
his pocket and was searching the ground.</p>

<p>“No sign of blood. He was rather difficult
to hit—I was afraid of hurting you, too.”</p>

<p>A window had been thrown up and Jack
Knebworth’s voice bawled into the night.</p>

<p>“What’s the shooting? Is that you,
Brixan?”</p>

<p>“It is I. Come down, and I’ll tell you all
about it.”</p>

<p>The noise did not seem to have aroused Mr.
Longvale, or, for the matter of that, any other
member of the party; and when Knebworth
reached the garden, he found no other audience
than Mike Brixan.</p>

<p>In a few words Michael told him what he
had seen.</p>

<p>“The monkey belongs to friend Penne,”
he said. “I saw it this morning.”</p>

<p>“What do you think—that he was prowling
round and saw the open window?”</p>

<p>Michael shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said quietly, “he came with one
intention and purpose, which was to carry off
your leading lady. That sounds highly
dramatic and improbable, and that is the
opinion I have formed. This ape, I tell you,
is nearly human.”</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t know the girl. He has
never seen her.”</p>

<p>“He could smell her,” said Mike instantly.
“She lost a pair of gloves at the Towers
to-day, and it’s any odds that they were stolen
by the noble Gregory Penne, so that he might
introduce to Bhag an unfailing scent.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it; it is incredible!
Though I’ll admit,” said Jack Knebworth
thoughtfully, “that these big apes do some
amazing things. Did you shoot him?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I didn’t shoot him, but I can tell
you this, that he’s an animal that’s been
gunned before, or he’d have come for me, in
which case he would have been now fairly
dead.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing round here,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“Just watching out,” said the other carelessly.
“The earnest detective has so many
things on his conscience that he can’t sleep
like ordinary people. Speaking for myself, I
never intended leaving the garden, because I
expected Brer Bhag. Who is that?”</p>

<p>The door opened, and a slim figure,
wrapped in a dressing-gown, came out into the
open.</p>

<p>“Young lady, you’re going to catch a
very fine cold,” warned Knebworth. “What
happened to you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” She was feeling her wrist
tenderly. “I heard something and went to the
window, and then this horrible thing caught
hold of me. What was it, Mr. Brixan?”</p>

<p>“It was nothing more alarming than a
monkey,” said he with affected unconcern.
“I’m sorry you were so scared. I guess the
shooting worried you more?”</p>

<p>“You don’t guess anything of the kind.
You know it didn’t. Oh, it was horrible,
horrible!” She covered her face with her
trembling hands.</p>

<p>Old Jack grunted.</p>

<p>“I think she’s right, too. You owe something
to our friend here, young lady.
Apparently he was expecting this visit and
watched in the garden.”</p>

<p>“You expected it?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Mr. Knebworth has made rather more of
the part I played than can be justified,” said
Mike. “And if you think that this is a hero’s
natural modesty, you’re mistaken. I did
expect this gentleman, because he’d been seen
in the fields by Mr. Longvale. And you
thought you saw him yourself, didn’t you,
Knebworth?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“In fact, we all saw him,” Mike went on,
“and as I didn’t like the idea of a coming
star (if I may express that pious hope) being
subjected to the annoyance of visiting monkeys,
I sat up in the garden.”</p>

<p>With a sudden impulsive gesture she put
out her little hand, and Michael took it.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Brixan,” she said. “I
have been wrong about you.”</p>

<p>“Who isn’t?” asked Mike with an
extravagant shrug.</p>

<p>She returned to her room, and this time she
closed her window. Once, before she went
finally to sleep, she rose and, peeping through
the curtains, saw the little glowing point of
the watcher’s cigar, and went back to bed
comforted, to sleep as if it were only for a few
minutes before Foss began knocking on the
doors to waken the company.</p>

<p>The literary man himself was the first down.
The garden was beginning to show palely in
the dawn light, and he bade Michael Brixan
a gruff good morning.</p>

<p>“Good morning to you,” said Michael.
“By the way, Mr. Foss, you stayed behind
at Griff Towers yesterday to see our friend
Penne?”</p>

<p>“That’s no business of yours,” growled the
man, and would have passed on, but Michael
stood squarely in his path.</p>

<p>“There is one thing which is a business of
mine, and that is to ask you why that little
white disc appears on Miss Leamington’s
window?”</p>

<p>He pointed up to the white circle that the
girl had seen the night before.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it,” said
Foss with rising anger, but there was also a
note of fear in his voice.</p>

<p>“If you don’t know, who will? Because I
saw you put it there, just before it got dark
last night.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you must know,” said the man,
“it was to mark a vision boundary for the
camera-man.”</p>

<p>That sounded a plausible excuse. Michael
had seen Jack Knebworth marking out
boundaries in the garden to ensure the actors
being in the picture. At the first opportunity,
when Knebworth appeared he questioned him
on the subject.</p>

<p>“No, I gave no instructions to put up
marks. Where is it?”</p>

<p>Michael showed him.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have a mark up there, anyway,
should I? Right in the middle of a window!
What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“I think Foss put it there with one object.
The window was marked at Gregory’s
request.”</p>

<p>“But why?” asked Knebworth, staring.</p>

<p>“To show Bhag Adele Leamington’s room.
That’s why,” said Michael, and he was
confident that his view was an accurate one.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch12'>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A CRY FROM A TOWER</span></h1></div>

<p>Michael did not wait to see the early morning
scenes shot. He had decided upon a course
of action, and as soon as he conveniently
could, he made his escape from the Dower
House, and, crossing a field, reached the road
which led to Griff Towers. Possessing a
good eye for country, he had duly noted the
field-path which ran along the boundary of
Sir Gregory Penne’s estate, and was, he
guessed, a short cut to Griff; and ten minutes’
walk brought him to the stile where the path
joined the road. He walked quickly, his eyes
on the ground, looking for some trace of the
beast; but there had been no rain, and, unless
he had wounded the animal, there was little
hope that he would pick up the track.</p>

<p>Presently he came to the high flint wall
which marked the southern end of the baronet’s
grounds, and this he followed until he came to
a postern let in the wall, a door that appeared
to have been recently in use, for it was ajar,
he noted with satisfaction.</p>

<p>Pushing it open, he found himself in a
large field which evidently served as kitchen
garden for the house. There was nobody in
sight. The grey tower looked even more
forbidding and ugly in the early morning
light. No smoke came from the chimneys;
Griff was a house of the dead. Nevertheless,
he proceeded cautiously, and, instead of
crossing the field, moved back into the shadow
of the wall until he reached the high boxwood
fence that ran at right angles and separated
the kitchen garden from that beautiful
pleasaunce which Jack Knebworth had used
the previous morning as a background for his
scenes.</p>

<p>And all the time he kept his eyes roving,
expecting at any moment to see the hideous
figure of Bhag appear from the ground. At
last he reached the end of the hedge. He was
now within a few paces of the gravelled front,
and less than half a dozen yards from the
high, square grey tower which gave the house
its name.</p>

<p>From where he stood he could see the
whole front of the house. The drawn white
blinds, the general lifelessness of Griff, might
have convinced a less sceptical man than Mike
Brixan that his suspicions were unfounded.</p>

<p>He was hesitating as to whether he should
go to the house or not, when he heard a crash
of glass, and looked up in time to see
fragments falling from the topmost room of
the tower. The sun had not yet risen, the
earth was still wrapped in the illusory dawn
light, and the hedge made an admirable
hiding-place.</p>

<p>Who was breaking windows at this hour of
the morning? Surely not the careful Bhag—so
far he had reached in his speculations
when the morning air was rent by a shrill
scream, of such fear that his flesh went cold.
It came from the upper room and ended
abruptly, as though somebody had put his hand
over the mouth of the unfortunate from whom
that cry of terror had been wrung.</p>

<p>Hesitating no longer, Michael stepped
from his place of concealment, ran quickly
across the gravel, and pulled at the bell before
the great entrance, which was immediately
under the tower. He heard the clang of the
bell and looked quickly round, to make
absolutely sure that Bhag or some of the
copper-coloured retainers of Griff Towers
were not trailing him.</p>

<p>A minute passed—two—and his hand was
again raised to the iron bell-pull, when he
heard heavy feet in the corridor, a shuffle of
slippers on the tiled floor of the hall, and a
gruff voice demanded:</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“Michael Brixan.”</p>

<p>There was a grunt, a rattle of chains, a
snapping of locks, and the big door opened
a few inches.</p>

<p>Gregory Penne was wearing a pair of grey
flannel trousers and a shirt, the wristbands of
which were unfastened. His malignant glare
changed to wonder at the sight of the detective.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he demanded, and
opened the door a few more inches.</p>

<p>“I want to see you,” said Michael.</p>

<p>“Usually call at daybreak?” growled the
man as he closed the door on his visitor.</p>

<p>Michael made no answer, but followed
Gregory Penne to his room. The library had
evidently been occupied throughout the night.
The windows were shuttered, the electroliers
were burning, and before the fire was a table
and two whisky bottles, one of which was
empty.</p>

<p>“Have a drink?” said Penne mechanically,
and poured himself out a portion with an
unsteady hand.</p>

<p>“Is your ape in?” asked Michael, refusing
the preferred drink with a gesture.</p>

<p>“What, Bhag? I suppose so. He goes
and comes as he likes. Do you want to see
him?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly,” said Michael. “I’ve
seen him once to-night.”</p>

<p>Penne was lighting the stub of a cigar from
the fire as he spoke, and he looked round
quickly.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen him before? What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“I saw him at the Dower House, trying to
get into Miss Leamington’s room, and he was
as near to being a dead orang-outang as he
has ever been.”</p>

<p>The man dropped the lighted spill on the
hearth and stood up.</p>

<p>“Did you shoot him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I shot at him.”</p>

<p>Gregory nodded.</p>

<p>“You shot at him,” he said softly. “That
accounts for it. Why did you shoot him?
He’s perfectly harmless.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t strike me that way,” said
Michael coolly. “He was trying to pull Miss
Leamington from her room.”</p>

<p>The man’s eyes opened.</p>

<p>“He got so far, did he? Well?”</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“You sent him to get the girl,” said
Michael. “You also bribed Foss to put a
mark on the window so that Bhag should know
where the girl was sleeping.”</p>

<p>He paused, but the other made no reply.</p>

<p>“The cave man method is fairly beastly,
even when the cave man does his own
kidnapping. When he sends an anthropoid
ape to do his dirty work, it passes into
another category.”</p>

<p>The man’s eyes were invisible now; his face
had grown a deeper hue.</p>

<p>“So that’s your line, is it?” he said. “I
thought you were a pal.”</p>

<p>“I’m not responsible for your illusions,”
said Michael. “Only I tell you this”—he
tapped the man’s chest with his finger—“if
any harm comes to Adele Leamington that is
traceable to you or your infernal agent, I
shan’t be contented with shooting Mr. Bhag;
I will come here and shoot you! Do you
understand? And now you can tell me, what
is the meaning of that scream I heard from
your tower?”</p>

<p>“Who the hell do you imagine you’re
cross-questioning?” spluttered Penne, livid
with fury. “You dirty, miserable little
actor!”</p>

<p>Michael slipped a card from his pocket and
put it in the man’s hand.</p>

<p>“You’ll find my title to question you legibly
inscribed,” he said.</p>

<p>The man brought the card to the table-lamp
and read it. The effect was electrical. His
big jaw dropped, and the hand that held the
card trembled so violently that it dropped to
the floor.</p>

<p>“A detective?” he croaked. “A—a
detective! What do you want here?”</p>

<p>“I heard somebody scream,” said Michael.</p>

<p>“One of the servants, maybe. We’ve got
a Papuan woman here who’s ill: in fact, she’s
a little mad, and we’re moving her to-morrow.
I’ll go and see if you like?”</p>

<p>He looked toward Michael as though
seeking permission. His whole attitude was
one of humility, and Michael required no more
than the sight of that pallid face and those
chattering teeth to turn his suspicion to
certainty. Something was happening in this
house that he must get to the bottom of.</p>

<p>“May I go and see?” asked Penne.</p>

<p>Michael nodded. The stout man shuffled
out of the room as though he were in a hurry
to be gone, and the lock clicked. Instantly
Michael was at the door, turned the handle
and pulled. It was locked!</p>

<p>He looked round the room quickly, and,
running to one of the windows, flung back the
curtain and pulled at the shutter. But this,
too, was locked. It was, to all intents and
purposes, a door with a little keyhole at the
bottom. He was examining this when all
the lights in the room went out, the only
illumination being a faint red glow from the
fire.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch13'>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE TRAP THAT FAILED</span></h1></div>

<p>And then Michael heard a faint creak in one
corner of the room. It was followed by the
almost imperceptible sound of bare feet on
the thick pile carpet, and the noise of quick
breathing.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate. Feeling again for
the keyhole of the shutter, he pulled out his
pistol and fired twice at the lock. The sound
of the explosion was deafening in the confined
space of the room. It must have had an
electrical effect upon the intruder, for when,
with a wrench, the shutter opened, and at
a touch the white blind sprang up, flooding with
light the big, ornate room, it was empty.</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterwards the door
opened through which the baronet had passed.
If he had been panic-stricken before, his
condition was now pitiable.</p>

<p>“What’s that? What’s that?” he whimpered.
“Did somebody shoot?”</p>

<p>“Somebody shot,” said Michael calmly,
“and I was the somebody. And the gentlemen
you sent into the room to settle accounts
with me are very lucky that I confined my
firing practice to the lock of your shutter,
Penne.”</p>

<p>He saw something white on the ground, and,
crossing the room with quick strides, picked it
up. It was a scarf of coarse silk, and he
smelt it.</p>

<p>“Somebody dropped this in their hurry,” he
said. “I guess it was to be used.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I assure you I didn’t
know.”</p>

<p>“How is the interesting invalid?” asked
Michael with a curl of his lip. “The lunatic
lady who screams?”</p>

<p>The man fingered his trembling lips for
a moment as though he were trying to control
them.</p>

<p>“She’s all right. It was as I—as I thought,”
he said; “she had some sort of fit.”</p>

<p>Michael eyed him pensively.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see her, if I may,” he said.</p>

<p>“You can’t.” Penne’s voice was loud,
defiant. “You can’t see anybody! What the
hell do you mean by coming into my house at
this hour of the morning and damaging my
property? I’ll have this matter reported to
Scotland Yard, and I’ll get the coat off your
back, my man! Some of you detectives think
you own the earth, but I’ll show you you
don’t!”</p>

<p>The blustering voice rose to a roar. He was
smothering his fear in weak anger, Michael
thought, and looked up at the swords above
the mantelpiece. Following the direction of
his eyes, Sir Gregory wilted, and again his
manner changed.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, why exasperate me? I’m
the nicest man in the world if you only treat me
right. You’ve got crazy ideas about me, you
have indeed!”</p>

<p>Michael did not argue. He walked slowly
down the passage and out to meet the first
sector of a blazing sun. As he reached the
door he turned to the man.</p>

<p>“I cannot insist upon searching your house
because I have not a warrant, as you know,
and, by the time I’d got a warrant, there would
be nothing to find. But you look out, my
friend!” He waved a warning finger at the
man. “I hate dragging in classical allusions,
but I should advise you to look up a lady in
mythology who was known to the Greeks as
Adrastia!”</p>

<p>And with this he left, walking down the drive,
watched with eyes of despair by a pale-faced
girl from the upper window of the tower, whilst
Sir Gregory went back to his library and,
by much diligent searching, discovered that
Adrastia was another name for Nemesis.</p>

<p>Michael was back at the Dower House in
time for breakfast. It was no great tribute
to his charm that his absence had passed
unnoticed—or so it appeared, though Adele
had marked his disappearance, and had been
the first to note his return.</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth was in his most cheery
mood. The scenes had been, he thought, most
successful.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell, of course, until I get back
to the laboratory and develop the pictures; but
so far as young Leamington is concerned,
she’s wonderful. I hate predicting at this early
stage, but I believe that she’s going to be a
great artiste.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t expect her to be?” said Michael
in surprise.</p>

<p>Jack laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>“I was very annoyed with Mendoza, and
when I took this outfit on location, I did so
quite expecting that I should have to return and
retake the picture with Mendoza in the cast.
Film stars aren’t born, they’re made; they’re
made by bitter experience, patience and suffering.
They have got to pass through stages of
stark inefficiency, during which they’re liable
to be discarded, before they win out. Your
girl has skipped all the intervening phases, and
has won at the first time of asking.”</p>

<p>“When you talk about ’my girl,’ ” said
Michael carefully, “will you be good enough
to remember that I have the merest and most
casual interest in the lady?”</p>

<p>“If you’re not a liar,” said Jack Knebworth,
“you’re a piece of cheese!”</p>

<p>“What chance has she as a film artiste?”
asked Michael, anxious to turn the subject.</p>

<p>Knebworth ruffled his white hair.</p>

<p>“Precious little,” he said. “There isn’t a
chance for a girl in England. That’s a horrible
thing to say, but it’s true. You can count the
so-called English stars on the fingers of one
hand; they’ve only a local reputation and
they’re generally married to the producer.
What chance has an outsider got of breaking
into the movies? And even if they break in,
it’s not much good to them. Production in
this country is streets behind production either
in America or in Germany. It is even behind
the French, though the French films are nearly
the dullest in the world. The British producer
has no ideas of his own; he can adopt and
adapt the stunts, the tricks of acting, the
methods of lighting, that he sees in foreign
films at trade shows; and, with the aid of an
American camera-man, he can produce something
which might have been produced a couple
of years ago at Hollywood. It’s queer, because
England has never been left behind as she has
been in the cinema industry. France started
the motor-car industry: to-day, England makes
the finest motor-car in the world. America
started aviation: to-day, the British aeroplanes
have no superior. And yet, with all the
example before them, with all the immense
profits which are waiting to be made, in the past
twenty years England has not produced one
film star of international note, one film picture
with an international reputation.”</p>

<p>It was a subject upon which he was
prepared to enlarge, and did enlarge, throughout
the journey back to Chichester.</p>

<p>“The cinema industry is in the hands of
showmen all the world over, but in England
it is in the hands of peep-showmen, as against
the Barnums of the States. No, there’s no
chance for your little friend, not in this country.
If the picture I’m taking makes a hit in America—yes.
She’ll be playing at Hollywood in
twelve months’ time in an English story—directed
by Americans!”</p>

<p>In the outer lobby of his office he found a
visitor waiting for him, and gave her a curt and
steely good morning.</p>

<p>“I want to see you, Mr. Knebworth,” said
Stella Mendoza, with a smile at the leading
man who had followed Knebworth into his
office.</p>

<p>“You want to see me, do you? Why, you
can see me now. What do you want?”</p>

<p>She was pulling at a lace handkerchief with
a pretty air of penitence and confusion. Jack
was not impressed. He himself had taught
her all that handkerchief stuff.</p>

<p>“I’ve been very silly, Mr. Knebworth, and
I’ve come to ask your pardon. Of course, it
was wrong to keep the boys and girls waiting,
and I really am sorry. Shall I come in the
morning? Or I can start to-day?”</p>

<p>A faint smile trembled at the corner of the
director’s big mouth.</p>

<p>“You needn’t come in the morning and you
needn’t stay to-day, Stella,” he said. “Your
substitute has done remarkably well, and I
don’t feel inclined to retake the picture.”</p>

<p>She flashed an angry glance at him, a glance
at total variance with her softer attitude.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a contract: I suppose you know
that, Mr. Knebworth?” she said shrilly.</p>

<p>“I’d ever so much rather play opposite
Miss Mendoza,” murmured a gentle voice. It
was the youthful Reggie Connolly, he of the
sleek hair. “It’s not easy to play opposite
Miss—I don’t even know her name. She’s so—well,
she lacks the artistry, Mr. Knebworth.”</p>

<p>Old Jack didn’t speak. His gloomy eyes
were fixed upon the youth.</p>

<p>“What’s more, I don’t feel I can do myself
justice with Miss Mendoza out of the cast,”
said Reggie. “I really don’t! I feel most
awfully, terribly nervous, and it’s difficult to
express one’s personality when one’s awfully,
terribly nervous. In fact,” he said recklessly,
“I’m not inclined to go on with the picture
unless Miss Mendoza returns.”</p>

<p>She shot a grateful glance at him, and then
turned with a slow smile to the silent Jack.</p>

<p>“Would you like me to start to-day?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, or any other day,” roared the
old director, his eyes flaming. “As for you,
you nut-fed chorus boy, if you try to let me
down I’ll blacklist you at every studio in this
country, and every time I meet you I’ll kick
you from hell to Halifax!”</p>

<p>He came stamping into the office, where
Michael had preceded him, a raging fury of a
man.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” he asked
when he had calmed down. “That’s the sort
of stuff they try to get past you! He’s going
to quit in the middle of a picture! Did you
hear him? That cissy-boy! That mouse!
Say, Brixan, would you like to play opposite
this girl of mine? You can’t be worse than
Connolly, and it would fill in your time whilst
you’re looking for the Head-Hunter.”</p>

<p>Michael shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” he said. “That is not my
job. And as for the Head-Hunter”—he lit a
cigarette and sent a ring of smoke to the ceiling—“I
know who he is and I can lay my hands
on him just when I want.”</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch14'>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MENDOZA MAKES A FIGHT</span></h1></div>

<p>Jack stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>“You’re joking!” he said.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I am very much in earnest,”
said Michael quietly. “But to know the Head-Hunter,
and to bring his crimes home to him,
are quite different matters.”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth sat at his desk, his hands
thrust into his trousers pockets, a look of blank
incredulity on the face turned to the detective.</p>

<p>“Is it one of my company?” he asked,
troubled, and Michael laughed.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the pleasure of knowing all your
company,” he said diplomatically, “but at any
rate, don’t let the Head-Hunter worry you.
What are you going to do about Mr. Reggie
Connolly?”</p>

<p>The director shrugged.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t mean it, and I was a fool to get
wild,” he said. “That kind of ninny never
means anything. You wouldn’t dream, to see
him on the screen, full of tenderness and love
and manliness, that he’s the poor little jellyfish
he is! As for Mendoza——” he swept his
hands before him, and the gesture was
significant.</p>

<p>Miss Stella Mendoza, however, was not
accepting her dismissal so readily. She had
fought her way up from nothing, and was
not prepared to forfeit her position without a
struggle. Moreover, her position was a serious
one. She had money—so much money that
she need never work again; for, in addition to
her big salary, she enjoyed an income from a
source which need not be too closely inquired
into. But there was a danger that Knebworth
might carry the war into a wider field.</p>

<p>Her first move was to go in search of Adele
Leamington, who, she learnt that morning for
the first time, had taken her place. Though
she went in a spirit of conciliation, she choked
with anger to discover that the girl was
occupying the star’s dressing-room, the room
which had always been sacred to Stella
Mendoza’s use. Infuriated, yet preserving an
outward calm, she knocked at the door. (That
she, Stella Mendoza, should knock at a door
rightfully hers was maddening enough!)</p>

<p>Adele was sitting at the bare dressing-table,
gazing, a little awe-stricken, at the array of
mirrors, lights and the vista of dresses down the
long alleyway which served as a wardrobe. At
the sight of Mendoza she went red.</p>

<p>“Miss Leamington, isn’t it?” asked Stella
sweetly. “May I come in?”</p>

<p>“Do, please,” said Adele, hastily rising.</p>

<p>“Please <em>do</em> sit down,” said Stella. “It’s a
very uncomfortable chair, but most of the chairs
here are uncomfortable. They tell me you
have been ‘doubling’ for me?”</p>

<p>“ ‘Doubling’?” said Adele, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Knebworth said he was ‘doubling’
you. You know what I mean: when an
artiste can’t appear, they sometimes put in an
understudy in scenes where she’s not very
distinctly shown—long shots——”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Knebworth took me close up,”
said the girl quietly. “I was only in one long
shot.”</p>

<p>Miss Mendoza masked her anger and sighed.</p>

<p>“Poor old chap! He’s very angry with me,
and really, I oughtn’t to annoy him. I’m
coming back to-morrow, you know.”</p>

<p>The girl went pale.</p>

<p>“It’s fearfully humiliating for you, I realize,
but, my dear, we’ve all had to go through that
experience. And people in the studio will be
very nice to you.”</p>

<p>“But it’s impossible,” said Adele. “Mr.
Knebworth told me I was to be in the picture
from start to finish.”</p>

<p>Mendoza shook her head smilingly.</p>

<p>“You can never believe what these fellows
tell you,” she said. “He’s just told me to be
ready to shoot to-morrow morning on the South
Downs.”</p>

<p>Adele’s heart sank. She knew that was
the rendezvous, though she was not aware of
the fact that Stella Mendoza had procured
her information from the disgruntled Mr.
Connolly.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> humiliating,” Stella went on thoughtfully.
“If I were you, I would go up to town
and stay away for a couple of weeks till the
whole thing has blown over. I feel very much
to blame for your disappointment, my dear,
and if money is any compensation——” She
opened her bag and, taking out a wad of
notes, detached four and put them on the
table.</p>

<p>“What is this for?” asked Adele coldly.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, you’ll want money for
expenses——”</p>

<p>“If you imagine I’m going to London
without seeing Mr. Knebworth and finding
out for myself whether you’re speaking the
truth——”</p>

<p>Mendoza’s face flamed.</p>

<p>“Do you suggest I’m lying?”</p>

<p>She had dropped all pretence of friendliness
and stood, a veritable virago, her hands on her
hips, her dark face thrust down into Adele’s.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you’re a liar or
whether you are mistaken,” said Adele, who
was less afraid of this termagant than she had
been at the news she had brought. “The
only thing I’m perfectly certain about is that
for the moment this is my room, and I will ask
you to leave it!”</p>

<p>She opened the door, and for a moment was
afraid that the girl would strike her; but the
broad-shouldered Irish dresser, a silent but
passionately interested spectator and audience,
interposed her huge bulk and good-humouredly
pushed the raging star into the corridor.</p>

<p>“I’ll have you out of there!” she screamed
across the woman’s shoulder. “Jack Knebworth
isn’t everything in this company! I’ve
got influence enough to fire Knebworth!”</p>

<p>The unrepeatable innuendoes that followed
were not good to hear, but Adele Leamington
listened in scornful silence. She was only too
relieved (for the girl’s fury was eloquent) to
know that she had not been speaking the truth.
For one horrible moment Adele had believed
her, knowing that Knebworth would not hesitate
to sacrifice her or any other member of the
company if, by so doing, the values of the
picture could be strengthened.</p>

<p>Knebworth was alone when his ex-star was
announced, and his first instinct was not to see
her. Whatever his intentions might have been,
she determined his action by appearing in the
doorway just as he was making up his mind what
line to take. He fixed her with his gimlet eyes
for a second, and then, with a jerk of his head,
called her in. When they were alone:</p>

<p>“There are many things I admire about you,
Stella, and not the least of them is your nerve.
But it is no good coming to me with any of
that let-bygones-be-bygones stuff. You’re not
appearing in this picture, and maybe you’ll
never appear in another picture of mine.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” she drawled, sitting down
uninvited, and taking from her bag a little gold
cigarette case.</p>

<p>“You’ve come in to tell me that you’ve got
influence with a number of people who are
financially interested in this corporation,” said
Jack, to her dismay. She wondered if there
were telephone communication between the
dressing-room and the office, then remembered
there wasn’t.</p>

<p>“I’ve handled a good many women in my
time,” he went on, “and I’ve never had to fire
one but she didn’t produce the President, Vice-President
or Treasurer and hold them over my
head with their feet ready to kick out my
brains! And, Stella, none of those hold-ups
have ever got past. People who are financially
interested in a company may love you to death,
but they’ve got to have the money to love you
with; and if I don’t make pictures that sell,
somebody is short of a perfectly good diamond
necklace.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see if Sir Gregory thinks the same
way,” she said defiantly, and Jack Knebworth
whistled.</p>

<p>“Gregory Penne, eh? I didn’t know you
had friends in that quarter. Yes, he is a stockholder
in the company, but he doesn’t hold
enough to make any difference. I guess he
told you that he did. And if he held ninety-nine
per cent. of it, Stella, it wouldn’t make
any difference to old Jack Knebworth, because
old Jack Knebworth’s got a contract which
gives him carte blanche, and the only getting
out clause is the one that gets <em>me</em> out! You
couldn’t touch me, Stella, no, ma’am!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re going to blacklist me?”
she said sulkily.</p>

<p>This was the one punishment she most feared—that
Jack Knebworth should circulate the
story of her unforgivable sin of letting down a
picture when it was half-shot.</p>

<p>“I thought about that,” he nodded, “but I
guess I’m not vindictive. I’ll let you go and
say the part didn’t suit you, and that you
resigned, which is as near the truth as any story
I’ll have to crack. Go with God, Stella. I
guess you won’t, because you’re not that way,
but—behave!”</p>

<p>He waved her out of the office and she went,
somewhat chastened. Outside the studio she
met Lawley Foss, and told him the result of
the interview.</p>

<p>“If it’s like that you can do nothing,” he
said. “I’d speak for you, Stella, but I’ve got
to speak for myself,” he added bitterly. “The
idea of a man of my genius truckling hat in
hand to this damned old Yankee is very
humiliating.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have your own company,
Lawley,” she said, as she had said a dozen
times before. “You write the stuff and I’ll be
the leading woman and put it over for you.
Why, you could direct Kneb’s head off. I
<em>know</em>, Lawley! I’ve been to the only place on
God Almighty’s earth where art is appreciated,
and I tell you that a four-flusher like Jack
Knebworth wouldn’t last a light-mile at Hollywood!”</p>

<p>“Light-mile” was a term she had acquired
from a scientific admirer. It had the double
advantage of sounding grand and creating a
demand for an explanation. To her annoyance,
Foss was sufficiently acquainted with
elementary physics to know that she meant the
period of time that a ray of light would take to
traverse a mile.</p>

<p>“Is he in his office now?”</p>

<p>She nodded, and without any further word
Lawley Foss, in some trepidation, knocked at
his chief’s door.</p>

<p>“The truth is, Mr. Knebworth, I want to ask
a favour of you.”</p>

<p>“Is it money?” demanded Jack, looking up
from under his bushy brows.</p>

<p>“Well, it was money, as a matter of fact.
There have been one or two little bills I’ve
overlooked, and the bailiffs have been after me.
I’ve got to raise fifty pounds by two o’clock this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>Jack pulled open a drawer, took out a book
and wrote a cheque, not for fifty pounds, but
for eighty.</p>

<p>“That’s a month’s salary in advance,” he
said. “You’ve drawn your pay up to to-day,
and by the terms of your contract you’re entitled
to one month’s notice or pay therefore. You’ve
got it.”</p>

<p>Foss went an ugly red.</p>

<p>“Does that mean I’m fired?” he asked
loudly.</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“You’re fired, not because you want money,
not because you’re one of the most difficult men
on the lot to deal with, but for what you did
last night, Foss.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean I am taking Mr. Brixan’s view, that
you fastened a white label to the window of
Miss Leamington’s room in order to guide
an agent of Sir Gregory Penne. That agent
came and nearly kidnapped my leading
lady.”</p>

<p>The man’s lip curled in a sneer.</p>

<p>“You’ve got melodrama in your blood,
Knebworth,” he said. “Kidnap your leading
lady! Those sort of things may happen in the
United States, but they don’t happen in
England.”</p>

<p>“Close the door as you go out,” said Jack,
preparing for his work.</p>

<p>“Let me say this——” began Foss.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you say nothing,” snarled Knebworth.
“I won’t even let you say ‘good-bye.’
Get!”</p>

<p>And, when the door slammed behind his
visitor, the old director pushed a bell on his
table, and, to his assistant who came:</p>

<p>“Get Miss Leamington down here,” he said.
“I’d like contact with something that’s wholesome.”</p>

<p>Chichester is not famous for its restaurants,
but the dining-room of a little hotel, where three
people foregathered that afternoon, had the
advantage of privacy.</p>

<p>When Mike Brixan got back to his hotel he
found two men waiting to see him, and, after
a brief introduction, he took them upstairs to
his sitting-room.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve come,” he said, when the
inspector had closed the door behind him.
“The fact is that sheerly criminal work is a
novelty to me, and I’m afraid that I’m going to
make it a mystery to you,” he smiled. “At
the moment I’m not prepared to give expression
to all my suspicions.”</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Lyle, the chief of the
two, laughed.</p>

<p>“We have been placed entirely under your
orders, Captain Brixan,” he said, “and neither
of us are very curious. The information you
asked for, Sergeant Walters has brought.”
He indicated his tall companion.</p>

<p>“Which information—about Penne? Is he
known to the police?” asked Michael,
interested.</p>

<p>Sergeant Walters nodded.</p>

<p>“He was convicted and fined a few years ago
for assaulting a servant—a woman. Apparently
he took a whip to the girl, and he very
narrowly escaped going to prison. That was
the first time our attention was attracted to him,
and we made inquiries both in London and in
the Malay States and found out all about him.
He’s a very rich man, and, being a distant
cousin of the late baronet, you may say he
fluked his title. In Borneo he lived up-country,
practically in the bush, for fifteen or twenty
years, and the stories we have about him aren’t
particularly savoury. There are a few of them
which you might read at your leisure, Mr.
Brixan—they’re in the record.”</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“Is anything known of an educated orang-outang
which is his companion?”</p>

<p>To his surprise, the officer answered:</p>

<p>“Bhag? Oh yes, we know all about him.
He was captured when he was quite a baby by
Penne, and was brought up in captivity. It
has been rather difficult to trace the man,
because he never returns to England by the
usual steamship line, so that it’s almost impossible
to have a tag on him. He has a yacht,
a fine sea-going boat, the <i epub:type="se:name.vehicle.boat">Kipi</i>, which is
practically officered and manned by Papuans.
What comes and goes with him I don’t know.
There was a complaint came through to us that
the last time he was abroad Penne nearly lost
his life as the result of some quarrel he had
with a local tribesman. Now, Mr. Brixan,
what would you like us to do?”</p>

<p>Michael’s instructions were few and brief.
That evening, when Adele walked home to her
lodgings, she was conscious that a man was
following her, and after her previous night’s
adventure this fact would have played havoc
with her nerves but for the note she found
waiting when she got indoors. It was from
Michael.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Would you mind if I put a Scotland Yard
man to watch you, to see that you do not get
into mischief! I don’t think there’s any danger
that you will, but I shall feel ever so much
easier in my mind if you will endure this
annoyance.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>She read the letter and her brows knit. So
she was being shadowed! It was an uncomfortable
experience, and yet she could not very
well object, could not indeed feel anything but
a sense of warm gratitude toward this ubiquitous
and pushful young man, who seemed determined
not to let her out of his sight.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch16'>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE BROWN MAN FROM NOWHERE</span></h1></div>

<p>With a brand-new grievance against life,
Lawley Foss gathered his forces to avenge
himself upon the world that had treated him so
harshly. And first and most powerful of his
forces was Stella Mendoza. There was a
council of war held in the drawing-room of the
pretty little house that Stella had taken when
she joined the Knebworth Corporation. The
third of the party was Mr. Reggie Connolly.
And as they were mutually sympathetic, so
were they mutually unselfish—characteristically
so.</p>

<p>“We’ve been treated disgracefully by Knebworth,
Mr. Foss, especially you. I think,
compared with your case, mine is nothing.”</p>

<p>“It is the way he has handled you that makes
me sore,” said Foss energetically. “An artiste
of your standing!”</p>

<p>“The work you’ve done for him! And
Reggie—he treated him like a dog!”</p>

<p>“Personally, it doesn’t matter to me,” said
Reggie. “I can always find a contract—it’s
you——”</p>

<p>“For the matter of that, we can <em>all</em> find
contracts,” interrupted Stella with a taste of
acid in her voice: “I can have my own company
when I please, and I’ve got two directors mad
to direct me, and two men I know would put
up every cent of money to give me my own
company—at least, they’d put up a lot. And
Chauncey Seller is raving to play opposite me,
and you know what a star he is; and he’d let
me be featured and go into small type himself.
He’s a lovely man, and the best juvenile in
this country or any other.”</p>

<p>Mr. Connolly coughed.</p>

<p>“The point is, can we get the money <em>now</em>?”
asked Foss, practical for once.</p>

<p>There was no immediate and enthusiastic
assurance from the girl.</p>

<p>“Because, if not, I think I can get all I
want,” said Foss surprisingly. “I won’t say
from whom, or how I’m going to get it. But
I’m certain I can get big money, and it will be
easier to get it for some specific object than to
ask for it for myself.”</p>

<p>“Less risky?” suggested Connolly, with a
desire to be in the conversation.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate remark, the more so
since by chance he had hit the nail on the head.
Foss went a dull red.</p>

<p>“What the hell do you mean by ‘less
risky’?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Poor Reggie had meant nothing, and
admitted as much in some haste. He had
meant to be helpful, and was ready to sulk at
the storm he had aroused. More ready
because, as the conversation had progressed,
he had faded more and more into the background
as an inconsiderable factor. There is
nothing quite so disheartening to a conspirator
as to find the conspiring taken out of his hands,
and Reggie Connolly felt it was the moment
to make a complete <i xml:lang="fr">volte face</i>, and incidentally
assert what he was pleased to call his
“personality.”</p>

<p>“This is all very well, Stella,” he said, “but
it looks to me as if I’m going to be left out in
the cold. What with your thinking about
Chauncey Seller—he’s let down more pictures
than any two men I know—and all that sort of
thing, I don’t see that I’m going to be much
use to you. I don’t really. I know you’ll
think I’m a fearful, awful rotter, but I feel that
we owe something to old Jack Kneb, I do
really. I’ve jeopardized my position for your
sake, and I’m prepared to do anything in
reason, but what with pulling Chauncey Seller—who
is a bounder of the worst kind—into your
cast, and what with Foss jumping down my
throat, well, really—really!”</p>

<p>They were not inclined to mollify him, having
rather an eye to the future than to the
present, and he had retired in a huff before the
girl realized that the holding of Reggie would
at least have embarrassed Knebworth to the
extent of forcing a retake of those parts of the
picture in which he appeared.</p>

<p>“Never mind about Connolly. The picture
is certain to fail with that extra: she’s bad. I
have a friend in London,” explained Foss, after
the discussion returned to the question of ways
and means, “who can put up the money. I’ve
got a sort of pull with him. In fact—well,
anyhow, I’ve got a pull. I’ll go up to-night
and see him.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll see mine,” said Stella. “We’ll
call the company The Stella Mendoza Picture
Corporation——”</p>

<p>Lawley Foss demurred. He was inclined to
another title, and was prepared to accept as a
compromise the Foss-Mendoza or F.M.
Company, a compromise agreeable to Stella
provided the initials were reversed.</p>

<p>“Who is Brixan?” she asked as Foss was
leaving.</p>

<p>“He is a detective.”</p>

<p>She opened her eyes wide.</p>

<p>“A detective? Whatever is he doing here?”</p>

<p>Lawley Foss smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>“He is trying to discover what no man of his
mental calibre will ever discover, the Head-Hunter.
I am the one man in the world who
could help him. Instead of which,” he smiled
again, “I am helping myself.”</p>

<p>With which cryptic and mystifying statement
he left her.</p>

<p>Stella Mendoza was an ambitious woman,
and when ambition is directed toward wealth
and fame it is not attended by scruple. Her
private life and her standard of values were no
better and no worse than thousands of other
women, and no more belonged to her profession
than did her passion for good food and luxurious
environment. The sins of any particular class
or profession are not peculiar to their status or
calling, but to their self-education in the matter
of the permissible. As one woman would die
rather than surrender her self-respect, so
another would lose her self-respect rather than
suffer poverty and hardship, and think little or
nothing of the act or the deceit she practised to
gain her ends.</p>

<p>After Foss had gone, she went up to her
room to change. It was too early to make the
call she intended, for Sir Gregory did not like
to see her during the daytime. He, who had
not hesitated to send Bhag on a fantastic
mission, was a stickler for the proprieties.</p>

<p>Having some letters to post, she drove into
Chichester late in the afternoon, and saw Mike
Brixan in peculiar circumstances. He was the
centre of a little crowd near the market cross,
a head above the surrounding people. There
was a policeman present: she saw his helmet,
and for a moment was inclined to satisfy her
curiosity. She changed her mind, and when
she returned the crowd had dispersed and
Michael had disappeared, and, driving home,
she wondered whether the detective had been
engaged professionally.</p>

<p>Mike himself had been attracted by the crowd
which was watching the ineffectual efforts of a
Sussex policeman to make himself intelligible
to a shock-haired, brown-faced native, an incongruous
figure in an ill-fitting suit of store
clothes and a derby hat which was a little too
large for him. In his hand he carried a bundle
tied up in a bright green handkerchief, and
under his arm a long object, wrapped in linen
and fastened with innumerable strings. At the
first sight of him Michael thought it was one
of Penne’s Malayan servants, but on second
thoughts he realized that Sir Gregory would
not allow any of his slaves to run loose about
the countryside.</p>

<p>Pushing his way through the crowd, he came
up to the policeman, who touched his helmet
rim and grinned.</p>

<p>“Can’t make head or tail of this fellow’s
lingo, sir,” he said. “He wants to know something,
but I can’t make out what. He has just
come into the city.”</p>

<p>The brown man turned his big dark eyes
upon Mike and said something which was
Greek to the detective. There was a curious
dignity about the native that even his ludicrous
garments could not wholly dissipate, an erectness
of body, a carriage of head, an imponderable
air of greatness that instantly claimed
Michael Brixan’s attention.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he had an inspiration, and
addressed the man in Dutch. Immediately the
native’s eyes lit up.</p>

<p>“<i >Ja, mynheer</i xml:lang="nl">, I speak Dutch.”</p>

<p>Mike had guessed that he came from Malaya,
where Dutch and Portuguese are spoken by the
better class natives.</p>

<p>“I am from Borneo, and I seek a man who is
called Truji, an Englishman. No, <i xml:lang="fr">mynheer</i>,
I wish to see his house, for he is a great man in
my country. When I have seen his house I
will go back to Borneo.”</p>

<p>Mike was watching him as he talked. It was
a particularly good-looking face, except for the
long and ugly scar that ran from his forehead
to the point of his jaw.</p>

<p>A new servant for Gregory Penne, thought
the detective, and gave him directions. Standing
by the policeman’s side, he watched the
queer figure with its bundles till it disappeared.</p>

<p>“Queer language, that, sir,” said the officer.
“It was Dutch to me.”</p>

<p>“And to me,” chuckled Mike, and continued
his way to the hotel.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch17'>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MR. FOSS MAKES A SUGGESTION</span></h1></div>

<p>Immersed in her beloved script, Adele
Leamington sat on her bed, a box of <i xml:lang="fr">marron
glacé</i> by her side, her knees tucked up, and a
prodigious frown on her forehead. Try as hard
as she would, she found it impossible to concentrate
upon the intricate directions with
which Foss invariably tortured the pages of his
scenarios. Ordinarily she could have mastered
this handicap, but, for some reason or other,
individual thoughts which belonged wholly to
her and had no association with her art came
flowing forth in such volume that the lines
were meaningless and the page, for all the
instruction it gave to her, might as well have
been blank.</p>

<p>What <em</em> Michael Brixan? He was not her
idea of a detective, and why was he staying in
Chichester? Could it be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ? She flushed
at the thought and was angry with herself. It
was hardly likely that a man who was engaged
in unravelling a terrible crime would linger for
the sake of being near to her. Was the Head-Hunter,
the murderer, living near Chichester?
She dropped her manuscript to her knees at
the appalling thought.</p>

<p>The voice of her landlady aroused her.</p>

<p>“Will you see Mr. Foss, miss?”</p>

<p>She jumped up from the bed and opened the
door.</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I’ve put him in the parlour,” said the
woman, who had grown a little more respectful
of late. Possibly the rise of the extra to
stardom was generally known in that small
town, which took an interest in the fortunes of
its one ewe lamb of a production company.</p>

<p>Lawley Foss was standing by the window,
looking out, when she came into the room.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Adele,” he said genially.
(He had never called her by her Christian name
before, even if he had known it.)</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Foss,” she said with
a smile. “I’m sorry to hear that you have left
us.”</p>

<p>Foss lifted his shoulders in a gesture of
indifference.</p>

<p>“The scope was a little too limited for my
kind of work,” he said.</p>

<p>He was wondering if Mike had told her about
the disc of paper on her window, and surmised
rightly that he had not. Foss himself did not
attach any significance to the white disc, accepting
Gregory’s explanation, which was that,
liking the girl, he wished to toss some flowers
and a present, by way of a peace offering,
through a window which he guessed would be
open. Foss had thought him a love-sick fool,
and had obliged him. The story that Knebworth
had told he dismissed as sheer melodrama.</p>

<p>“Adele, you’re a foolish little girl to turn
down a man like Gregory Penne,” he said, and
saw by her face that he was on dangerous
ground. “There’s no sense in getting up in
the air; after all, we’re human beings, and it
isn’t unnatural that Penne should have a crush
on you. There’s nothing wrong in that.
Hundreds of girls have dinner with men without
there being anything sinister in it. I’m a
friend of Penne’s, in a way, and I’m seeing
him to-night on a very important and personal
matter—will you come along?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“There may be no harm in it,” she said,
“but there is no pleasure in it either.”</p>

<p>“He’s a rich man and a powerful man,” said
Foss impressively. “He could be of service
to you.”</p>

<p>Again she shook her head.</p>

<p>“I want no other help than my own ability,”
she said. “I nearly said ‘genius,’ but that
would have sounded like conceit. I do not
need the patronage of any rich man. If I cannot
succeed without that, then I am a hopeless
failure and am content to be one!”</p>

<p>Still Foss lingered.</p>

<p>“I think I can manage without you,” he said,
“but I’d have been glad of your co-operation.
He’s crazy about you. If Mendoza knew that,
she’d kill you!”</p>

<p>“Miss Mendoza?” gasped the girl. “But
why? Does she—she know him?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes: very few people are aware of the
fact. There was a time when he’d have done
anything for her, and she was a wise girl:
she let him help! Mendoza has money to
burn and diamonds enough to fill the Jewel
House.”</p>

<p>Adele listened, horror-stricken, incredulous,
and he hastened to insure himself against
Stella’s wrath.</p>

<p>“You needn’t tell her I told you—this is
in strict confidence. I don’t want to get on
the wrong side of Penne either,” he shivered.
“That man’s a devil!”</p>

<p>Her lips twitched.</p>

<p>“And yet you calmly ask me to dine with
him, and hold out the bait of Miss Mendoza’s
diamonds!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think she’s awful,” he
sneered.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry for her,” said the girl
quietly, “and I am determined not to be sorry
for myself!”</p>

<p>She opened the door to him in silence, and
in silence he took his departure. After all,
he thought, there was no need for any outside
help. In his breast pocket was a sheet of
manuscript, written on the Head-Hunter’s
typewriter. That ought to be worth thousands
when he made his revelation.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch18'>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE FACE IN THE PICTURE</span></h1></div>

<p>Mr. Sampson Longvale was taking a gentle
constitutional on the strip of path before his
untidy house. He wore, as usual—for he was
a creature of habit—a long, grey silk dressing-gown,
fastened by a scarlet sash. On his
head was his silk nightcap, and between his
teeth a clay churchwarden pipe, which he
puffed solemnly as he walked.</p>

<p>He had just bidden a courteous good night
to the help who came in daily to tidy his living-rooms
and prepare his simple meals, when he
heard the sound of feet coming up the drive.
He thought at first it was the woman returning
(she had a habit of forgetting things); but when
he turned, he saw the unprepossessing figure
of a neighbour with whom he was acquainted in
the sense that Sir Gregory Penne had twice
been abominably rude to him.</p>

<p>The old man watched with immobile
countenance the coming of his unwelcome
visitor.</p>

<p>“ ’Evening!” growled Penne. “Can I
speak to you privately?”</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale inclined his head courteously.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Sir Gregory. Will you come
in?”</p>

<p>He ushered the owner of Griff Towers into
the long sitting-room and lit the candles. Sir
Gregory glanced round, his lips curled in
disgust at the worn poverty of the apartment,
and when the old man had pushed up a chair
for him, it was some time before he accepted
the offer.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said Mr. Longvale courteously,
“to what circumstances do I owe the pleasure
of this visit?”</p>

<p>“You had some actors staying here the
other day?”</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale inclined his head.</p>

<p>“There was some fool talk about a monkey
of mine trying to get into the house.”</p>

<p>“A monkey?” said Mr. Longvale in gentle
surprise. “That is the first I have heard of
monkeys.”</p>

<p>Which was true. The other looked at him
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” he asked. “You’re not
going to persuade me you didn’t hear?”</p>

<p>The old man stood up, a picture of dignity.</p>

<p>“Do you suggest that I am lying, sir?” he
said. “Because, if you do, there is the door!
And though it hurts me to be in the least
degree discourteous to a guest of mine, I am
afraid I have no other course than to ask you
to leave my house.”</p>

<p>“All right, all right,” said Sir Gregory
Penne impatiently. “Don’t lose your temper,
my friend. I didn’t come to see you about
that, anyway. You’re a doctor, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale was obviously startled.</p>

<p>“I practised medicine when I was younger,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Poor, too?” Gregory looked round.
“You haven’t a shilling in the world, I’ll
bet!”</p>

<p>“There you are wrong,” said old Mr.
Longvale quietly. “I am an extremely
wealthy man, and the fact that I do not keep
my house in repair is due to the curious
penchant of mine for decaying things. That
is an unhealthy, probably a morbid predilection
of mine. How did you know I was a
doctor?”</p>

<p>“I heard through one of my servants.
You set the broken finger of a carter.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t practised for years,” said Mr.
Longvale. “I almost wish I had,” he added
wistfully. “It is a noble science——”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” interrupted Penne, “even if
you can’t be bought, you’re a secretive old
devil, and that suits me. There’s a girl up
at my house who is very ill. I don’t want any
of these prying country doctors nosing around
my private affairs. Would you come along
and see her?”</p>

<p>The old man pursed his lips thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I should be most happy,” he said, “but
I am afraid my medical science is a little
rusty. Is she a servant?”</p>

<p>“In a way,” said the other shortly. “When
can you come?”</p>

<p>“I’ll come at once,” said Mr. Longvale
gravely, and went out, to return in his greatcoat.</p>

<p>The baronet looked at the ancient garment
with a smile of derision.</p>

<p>“Why the devil do you wear such old-fashioned
clothes?” he asked.</p>

<p>“To me they are very new,” said the old
man gently. “The garments of to-day are
without romance, without the thrill which
these bring to me.” He patted the overlapping
cape and smiled. “An old man is
entitled to his fancies: let me be humoured,
Sir Gregory.”</p>

<p>At the moment Mr. Sampson Longvale
was driving to Griff Towers, Mike Brixan,
summoned by messenger, was facing Jack
Knebworth in his office.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t mind my sending for
you, though it was a fool thing to do,” said
the director. “You remember that we shot
some scenes at Griff Towers?”</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“I want you to see one that we took, with
the tower in the background, and tell me what
you think of—something.”</p>

<p>Wonderingly, Michael accompanied the
director to the projection room.</p>

<p>“My laboratory manager pointed it out to
me in the negative,” explained Jack as they
seated themselves and the room went dark.
“Of course, I should have seen it in the print.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Michael curiously.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I don’t know,” said the
other, scratching his head, “but you’ll see for
yourself.”</p>

<p>There was a flicker and a furious clicking,
and there appeared on the small screen which
was used for projection purposes, a picture of
two people. Adele was one and Reggie
Connolly the other, and Michael gazed stolidly,
though with rising annoyance, at a love scene
which was being enacted between the two.</p>

<p>In the immediate background was the wall
of the tower, and Michael saw for the first
time that there was a little window which he
did not remember having seen from the interior
of the hall; it was particularly dark, and was
lighted, even in daytime, by electric lamps.</p>

<p>“I never noticed that window before,” he
said.</p>

<p>“It’s the window I want you to watch,” said
Jack Knebworth, and, even as he spoke, there
came stealthily into view a face.</p>

<p>At first it was indistinct and blurred, but
later, it came into focus. It was the oval face
of a girl, dark-eyed, her hair in disorder, a
look of unspeakable terror on her face. She
raised her hand as if to beckon somebody—probably
Jack himself, who was directing the
picture. That, at least, was Jack’s view.
They had hardly time to get accustomed to
the presence of the mystery girl when she
disappeared, with such rapidity as to suggest
that she had been dragged violently back.</p>

<p>“What do you make of that?” asked
Knebworth.</p>

<p>Michael bit his lip thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Looks almost as though friend Penne had
a prisoner in his dark tower. Of course, the
woman whose scream I heard, and who he
said was a servant! But the window puzzles
me. There’s no sign of it inside. The
stairway leads out of the hall, but in such a
position that it is impossible that the girl could
have been standing either on the stairs or the
landing. Therefore, there must be a fifth wall
inside, containing a separate staircase. Does
this mean you will have to retake?”</p>

<p>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, we can back her out: she’s only on
fifty feet of the film; but I thought you’d like
to see it.”</p>

<p>The lights came on again, and they went
back to the director’s office.</p>

<p>“I don’t like Penne, for more reasons than
one,” said Jack Knebworth. “I like him less
since I’ve found that he’s better friends with
Mendoza than I thought he was.”</p>

<p>“Who is Mendoza—the deposed star?”</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>“Stella Mendoza—not a bad girl and not a
good girl,” he said. “I’ve been wondering
why Penne always gave us permission to use
his grounds for shooting, and now I know. I
tell you that that house holds a few secrets!”</p>

<p>Michael smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“One, at least, of them will be revealed
to-night,” he said. “I am going to explore
Griff Towers, and I do not intend asking
permission of Sir Gregory Penne. And if I
can discover what I believe is there to be
discovered, Gregory Penne will sleep under
lock and key this night!”</p>

<p>Michael Brixan had had sent down to him
from town a heavy suit-case, which contained
precious little clothing. He was busy with its
contents for half an hour, when the boots of
the hotel announced the arrival of the motor-cycle
that had been hired for him.</p>

<p>With a canvas bag strapped to his back, he
mounted the machine, and was soon clear of
the town, swerving through the twisting lanes
of Sussex until he arrived at the Dower House,
behind which he concealed his machine.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock when he crossed the
fields to the postern gate, on the alert all the
time for the soft-footed Bhag. The postern
was closed and locked—a contingency for
which he was prepared. Unstrapping his bag,
he took therefrom a bundle of rods, and
screwed three together. To the top he
fastened a big, blunt hook, and, replacing the
remainder of the rods, he lifted the hook till
it rested on the top of the high wall, tested
its stability, and in a few seconds had climbed
his “ladder” and had jumped to the other
side.</p>

<p>He followed the path that he had taken
before, keeping close to the bushes, and all
the time watching left and right for Penne’s
monstrous servant. As he came to the end of
the hedge, the hall door opened and two men
came out. One was Penne, and for a moment
he did not recognize the tall man by his side,
until he heard his voice. Mr. Sampson
Longvale!</p>

<p>“I think she will be all right. The wounds
are very peculiar. It looks almost as if she
had been scratched by some huge claw,” said
Longvale. “I hope I have been of assistance,
Sir Gregory, though, as I told you, it is nearly
fifty years since I engaged in medical work.”</p>

<p>So old Longvale had been a doctor!
Somehow this news did not surprise Michael.
There was something in the old man’s
benevolence of countenance and easy manner
which would have suggested a training in that
profession, to one less analytical than Michael
Brixan.</p>

<p>“My car will take you down,” he heard
Sir Gregory say.</p>

<p>“No, no, thank you; I will walk. It is
not very far. Good night, Sir Gregory.”</p>

<p>The baronet growled a good night and went
back into the dimly-lit hall, and Michael
heard the rattle of chains as the door was
fastened.</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost. Almost
before Mr. Sampson Longvale had disappeared
into the darkness, Michael had opened his
canvas bag and had screwed on three more
links to his ladder. From each rod projected
a short, light, steel bracket. It was the type
of hook-ladder that firemen use, and Michael
had employed this method of gaining entrance
to a forbidden house many times in his
chequered career.</p>

<p>He judged the distance accurately, for when
he lifted the rod and dropped the hook upon
the sill of the little window, the ladder hung
only a few inches short of the ground. With
a tug to test the hook, he went up hand over
hand, and in a few seconds was prying at the
window sash. It needed little opening, for
the catch was of elementary simplicity, and
in another instant he was standing on the step
of a dark and narrow stairway.</p>

<p>He had provided himself with an electric
torch, and he flashed a beam up and down.
Below, he saw a small door which apparently
led into the hall, and, by an effort of memory,
he remembered that in the corner of the hall
he had seen a curtain hanging, without
attaching any importance to the fact. Going
down, he tried the door and found it locked.
Putting down his lantern, he took out a leather
case of tools and began to manipulate the lock.
In an incredibly short space of time the key
turned. When he had assured himself that
the door would open, he was satisfied. For
the moment his work lay upstairs, and he
climbed the steps again, coming to a narrow
landing, but no door.</p>

<p>A second, a third and a fourth flight brought
him, as near as he could guess, to the top of
the tower, and here he found a narrow exit.
Listening, after a while he heard somebody
moving about the room, and by the sound
they made, he supposed they wore slippers.
Presently a door closed with a thud, and he
tried the handle of the wicket. It was
unlocked, and he opened it gently a fraction
of an inch at a time, until he secured a view
of the greater part of the chamber.</p>

<p>It was a small, lofty room, unfurnished with
the exception of a low bed in one corner, on
which a woman lay. Her back was toward
him, fortunately; but the black hair and the
ivory yellow of the bare arm that lay on the
coverlet told him that she was not European.</p>

<p>Presently she turned and he saw her face,
recognizing her immediately as the woman
whose face he had seen in the picture. She
was pretty in her wild way, and young. Her
eyes were closed, and presently she began
crying softly in her sleep.</p>

<p>Michael was half-way in the room when he
saw the handle of the other door turn, and,
quick as a flash, stepped back into the
darkness of the landing.</p>

<p>It was Bhag, in his old blue overall, a tray
of food in his great hands. He reached out
his foot and pulled the table toward him,
placing the viands by the side of the bed.
The girl opened her eyes and sank back with
a little cry of disgust; and Bhag, who was
evidently used to these demonstrations of her
loathing, shuffled out of the room.</p>

<p>Again Michael pushed the door and crossed
the room, unnoticed by the girl, looking out
into the passage—not six feet away from him,
Bhag was squatting, glaring in his direction.</p>

<p>Michael closed the door quickly and flew
back to the secret staircase, pulling the door
behind him. He felt for a key, but there was
none, and, without wasting another second,
he ran down the stairs. The one thing he
wished to avoid was an encounter which would
betray his presence in the house.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to get out of the
window, but continued his way to the foot of
the stairs, and passed through into the hall.
This time he was able to close the door, for
there were two large bolts at the top and the
bottom. Pulling aside the curtain, he stepped
gingerly into the hall. For a while he waited,
and presently heard the shuffle of feet on the
stairs and a sniff beneath the door.</p>

<p>His first act was to ensure his retreat.
Noiselessly he drew the bolts from the front
door, slipped off the chain and turned the key.
Then, as noiselessly, he made his way along
the corridor toward Sir Gregory’s room.</p>

<p>The danger was that one of the native
servants would see him, but this he must risk.
He had observed on each of his previous visits
that, short of the library, a door opened into
what he knew must be an ante-room of some
kind. It was unlocked and he stepped into
complete darkness. Groping along the wall,
he found a row of switches, and pulled
down the first. This lit two wall-brackets,
sufficient to give him a general view of the
apartment.</p>

<p>It was a small drawing-room, apparently
unused, for the furniture was sheeted with
holland, and the fire-grate was empty. From
here it was possible to gain access to the
library through a door near the window. He
switched off the light, locked the door on the
inside, and tried the shutters. These were
fastened by iron bars and were not, as in the
case of the library, locked. He pulled them
back, let the blind up, and gingerly raised
a window. His second line of retreat was
now prepared, and he could afford to take
risks.</p>

<p>Kneeling down, he looked through the
keyhole. The library was illuminated, and
somebody was talking. A woman! Turning
the handle, he opened the door the fraction of
an inch, and had a view of the interior.</p>

<p>Gregory Penne was standing in his favourite
attitude, with his back to the fire, and before
him was a tray of those refreshments without
which life was apparently insupportable.
Seated on the low settee, drawn up at one
side of the fireplace, was Stella Mendoza.
She was wearing a fur coat, for the night was
chilly, and about her neck was such a sparkle
of gems as Michael had never seen before on
a woman.</p>

<p>Evidently the discussion was not a pleasant
one, for there was a heavy scowl on Gregory’s
face, and Stella did not seem too pleased.</p>

<p>“I left you because I had to leave you,”
growled the man, answering some complaint
she had made. “One of my servants is ill
and I brought in the doctor. And if I had
stayed it would have been the same. It’s no
good, my girl,” he said harshly. “The goose
doesn’t lay golden eggs more than once—this
goose doesn’t, at any rate. You were a fool
to quarrel with Knebworth.”</p>

<p>She said something which did not reach
Michael’s ears.</p>

<p>“I dare say your own company would be
fine,” said Penne sarcastically. “It would be
fine for me, who footed the bill, and finer for
you, who spent the money! No! Stella, that
cat doesn’t jump. I’ve been very good to
you, and you’ve no right to expect me to
bankrupt myself to humour your whims.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a whim,” she said vehemently,
“it’s a necessity. You don’t want to see me
going round the studios taking any kind of job
I can get, do you, Gregory?” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see you work at all, and
there’s no reason why you should. You’ve
enough to live on. Anyway, you’ve got
nothing against Knebworth. If it hadn’t
been for him, you wouldn’t have met me, and
if you hadn’t met me, you’d have been poorer
by thousands. You want a change.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Her head was
drooped, and Michael could not see the girl’s
face, but when she spoke, there was that note
of viciousness in her voice which told him her
state of mind.</p>

<p>“You want a change too, perhaps! I
could tell things about you that wouldn’t look
good in print, and you’d have a change too!
Get that in your mind, Gregory Penne! I’m
not a fool—I’ve seen things and heard things,
and I can put two and two together. You
think I want a change, do you—I do! I
want friends who aren’t murderers——”</p>

<p>He sprang at her, his big hand covering her
mouth.</p>

<p>“You little devil!” he hissed, and at that
instant somebody must have knocked, for he
turned to the door and said something in the
native dialect.</p>

<p>The answer was inaudible to Mike.</p>

<p>“Listen.” Gregory was speaking to the
girl in a calmer tone. “Foss is waiting to see
me, and I’ll discuss this little matter with you
afterwards.”</p>

<p>He released her, and, going to his
desk, touched the spring that operated the
mechanism of the secret door that led to
Bhag’s quarters.</p>

<p>“Go in there and wait,” he said. “I’ll not
keep you longer than five minutes.”</p>

<p>She looked suspiciously at the door which
had suddenly opened in the panelling.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “I’ll go home. To-morrow
will do. I’m sorry I got rough,
Gregory, but you madden me sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Go in there!”</p>

<p>He pointed to the den, his face working.</p>

<p>“I’ll not!” Her face was white. “You
beast, don’t you think I know? That is
Bhag’s den! Oh, you beast!”</p>

<p>His face was horrible to see. It was as
though all the foulness in his mind found
expression in the demoniacal grimace.</p>

<p>Breathless, terrified, the girl stared at him,
shrinking back against the wall. Presently
Gregory mastered himself.</p>

<p>“Then go into the little drawing-room,” he
said huskily.</p>

<p>Mike had time to switch out the lights and
flatten himself against the wall, when the door
of the room was flung open and the girl thrust
in.</p>

<p>“It is dark!” she wailed.</p>

<p>“You’ll find the switches!”</p>

<p>The door banged.</p>

<p>Michael Brixan was in a dilemma. He
could see her figure groping along the wall,
and stealthily he moved to avoid her. In
doing so he stumbled over a stool.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” she screamed. “Gregory!
Don’t let him touch me, Gregory!”</p>

<p>Again the piercing scream.</p>

<p>Mike leapt past her and through the open
window, and, the sound of her shrill agony in
his ears, fled along the hedge. Swift as he
was, something sped more quickly in pursuit,
a great, twittering something that ran bent
double on hands and feet. The detective
heard and guessed. From what secret hiding-place
Bhag had appeared, whether he was in
the grounds at the moment Mike jumped, he
had no time even to guess. He felt a curious
lightness of pocket at that moment and thrust
in his hand. His pistol was gone. It must
have fallen when he jumped.</p>

<p>He could hear the pad of feet behind him
as he darted at a tangent across the field,
blundering over the cabbage rows, slipping
in furrows, the great beast growing closer and
closer with every check. Ahead of him the
postern. But it was locked, and, even if it had
not been, the wall would have proved no
obstacle to the ape. The barrier of the wall
held Michael. Breathless, turning to face his
pursuer, in the darkness he saw the green eyes
shining like two evil stars.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch20'>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A NARROW ESCAPE</span></h1></div>

<p>Michael Brixan braced himself for the supreme
and futile struggle. And then, to his amazement,
the ape stopped, and his bird noise
became a harsh chatter. Raising himself erect,
he beat quickly on his great hairy chest, and
the sound of the hollow drumming was awful.</p>

<p>Yet through that sound and above it,
Michael heard a curious hiss—it was the faint
note of escaping steam, and he looked round.
On the top of the wall squatted a man, and
Michael knew him at once. It was the brown-faced
stranger he had seen that day in
Chichester.</p>

<p>The drumming and the hissing grew louder
and then Michael saw a bright, curved thing in
the brown man’s hand. It was a sword, the
replica of that which hung above Sir Gregory’s
fireplace.</p>

<p>He was still wondering when the brown man
dropped lightly to the ground, and Bhag, with
a squeal that was almost human, turned and
fled. Michael watched the Thing, fascinated,
until it disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said Michael in Dutch, “you
came at a good moment.”</p>

<p>He turned, but the brown man had vanished
as though the earth had swallowed him.
Shading his eyes against the starlight, he
presently discerned a dark shape moving swiftly
in the shadow of the wall. For a second he
was inclined to follow and question the brown
man, but decided upon another course. With
some difficulty he surmounted the wall and
dropped to the other side. Then, tidying
himself as well as he could, he made the long
circuit to the gate of Griff Towers, and boldly
walked up to the house, whistling as he went.</p>

<p>There was nobody in sight as he crossed the
“parade ground,” and his first step was to
search for and find his pistol.</p>

<p>He must know that the girl was safe before
he left the place. He had seen her car waiting
on the road outside. His hand was raised to
the bell when he heard footsteps in the hall,
and listened intently: there was no doubt that
one of the voices was Stella Mendoza’s, and
he drew back again to cover.</p>

<p>The girl came out, followed by Sir Gregory,
and from their tone, a stranger unacquainted
with the circumstances of their meeting might
have imagined that the visit had been a very
ordinary one, in spite of the lateness of the
hour.</p>

<p>“Good night, Sir Gregory,” said the girl,
almost sweetly. “I will see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Come to lunch,” said Gregory’s voice, “and
bring your friend. Shall I walk with you to
the car?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” she said hastily.</p>

<p>Michael watched her till she was out of sight,
but long before then the big door of Griff
Towers had closed, and the familiar rattle of
chains told him that it was closed finally.</p>

<p>Where was Foss? He must have gone
earlier, if Foss it was. Michael waited till all
was quiet, and then, tip-toeing across the gravel,
followed the girl. He looked about for the
little brown man, but he was not in sight. And
then he remembered that he had left the hook
ladder hanging to the window on the stairs,
and went back to retrieve it. He found the
ladder as it had been left, unscrewed and
packed it in the canvas bag, and five minutes
later he was taking his motor-cycle from its
place of concealment.</p>

<p>A yellow light showed in the window of
Mr. Longvale’s dining-room, and Michael had
half a mind to call upon him. He could tell
him, at any rate, something of that oval-faced
girl in the upper room of the tower. Instead,
he decided to go home. He was tired with
the night’s work, a little disappointed. The
tower had not revealed as tremendous a secret
as he had hoped. The girl was a prisoner,
obviously; had been kidnapped for Sir
Gregory’s pleasure, and brought to England
on his yacht. Such things had happened;
there had been a case in the courts on curiously
parallel lines only a few months before. At
any rate, it did not seem worth while to put off
his bedtime.</p>

<p>He had a hot bath, made himself some
chocolate and, before retiring, sat down to sum
up his day’s experience. And in the light of
recent happenings he was less confident that his
first solution of the Head-Hunter mystery was
the correct one. And the more he thought,
the less satisfied he was, till at last, in sheer
disgust at his own vacillation of mind, he turned
out the light and went to bed.</p>

<p>He was sleeping peacefully and late the
next morning when an unexpected visitor
arrived, and Michael sat up in bed and rubbed
his eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ve either got nightmare or it’s Staines,”
he said.</p>

<p>Major Staines smiled cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You’re awake and normal,” he said.</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” asked Michael,
springing out of bed.</p>

<p>“Nothing, only there was a late dance last
night and an early train this morning, and
I decided to atone for my frivolity by coming
down and seeing how far you had got in the
Elmer case.”</p>

<p>“Elmer case?” Michael frowned. “Good
Lord! I’d almost forgotten poor Elmer!”</p>

<p>“Here’s something to remind you,” said
Staines.</p>

<p>He fished from his pocket a newspaper
cutting. Michael took it and read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Is your trouble of mind or body incurable?
Do you hesitate on the brink of the abyss?
Does courage fail you?&nbsp;&nbsp;Write to Benefactor,
Box——”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“What is this?” asked Michael, frowning.</p>

<p>“It was found in the pocket of an old
waistcoat that Elmer was wearing a few days
before he disappeared. Mrs. Elmer was
going through his clothes with the idea of
selling them, when she found this. It appeared
in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Morning Telegram</i> of the fourteenth—that
is to say, three or four days before Elmer
vanished. The box number at the end, of
course, is the box number of the newspaper to
which replies were sent. There is a record
that four letters reached the ‘Benefactor,’ who,
so far as we have been able to discover, had
these particular letters readdressed to a little
shop in Stibbington Street, London. Here
they were collected by a woman, evidently of
the working class, and probably a charlady
from the appearance which has been circulated.
Beyond that, no further trace has been obtainable.
Similar advertisements have been found
by search in other newspapers, but in these
cases the letters were sent to an accommodation
address in South London, where apparently
the same woman collected them. With every
new advertisement the advertiser changes his
address. She was a stranger to each neighbourhood,
by the way; and from what shopkeepers
have told Scotland Yard, she seemed
to be a little off her head, for she was in
the habit of mumbling and talking to herself.
Her name is Stivins—at least, that is the name
she always gave. And the notes she brought
were usually signed ‘Mark’—that is to say,
the notes authorizing the shopkeepers to hand
the letters to her. That she is a native of
London there is no doubt, but so far the police
have not trailed her.”</p>

<p>“And suppose they do?” asked Michael.
“Do you connect the advertisement with the
murders?”</p>

<p>“We do and we do not,” replied the other.
“I merely point out that this advertisement is
a peculiar one, and in all the circumstances a
little suspicious. Now what is the theory you
wanted to give me?”</p>

<p>For an hour Michael spoke, interrupted at
intervals by questions which Staines put to him.</p>

<p>“It is a queer idea, almost a fantastical one,”
said Staines gravely, “but if you feel that you’ve
got so much as one thread in your hands,
go right ahead. To tell you the truth,” in a
burst of confidence, “I had a horrible feeling
that you had fallen down; and since I do not
want our department to be a source of amusement
to Scotland Yard, I thought I’d come
along and give you the result of my own
private investigations. I agree with you,” he
said later, as they sat at breakfast, “that you
want to go very, very carefully. It is a delicate
business. You haven’t told the Scotland Yard
men your suspicions?”</p>

<p>Michael shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then don’t,” said the other emphatically.
“They’d be certain to go along and put the
person you suspect under arrest, and probably
that would destroy the evidence that would
convict. You say you have made a search of
the house?”</p>

<p>“Not a search: I’ve made a rough inspection.”</p>

<p>“Are there cellars?”</p>

<p>“I should imagine so,” said Michael. “That
type of house usually has.”</p>

<p>“Outhouses where——?”</p>

<p>Michael shook his head.</p>

<p>“There are none, so far as I have been able
to see.”</p>

<p>Michael walked down to the railway station
with his chief, who told him he was leaving in
a much more cheerful frame of mind than he
had been in when he arrived.</p>

<p>“There’s one warning I’ll give to you,
Mike,” said Staines as the train was about to
pull out of the station, “and it is to watch out
for yourself! You’re dealing with a ruthless
and ingenious man. For heaven’s sake do not
underrate his intelligence. I don’t want to
wake up one morning to learn that you have
vanished from the ken of man.”</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch21'>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ERASURE</span></h1></div>

<p>Mike’s way back did not lead through the
little street where Adele Leamington lived—at
least, not his nearest road. Yet he found
himself knocking at the door, and learnt, with
a sense of disappointment, that the girl had
been out since seven o’clock in the morning.
Knebworth was shooting on the South Downs,
and the studio, when he arrived, was empty,
except for Knebworth’s secretary and the new
scenario editor, who had arrived late on the
previous evening.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the location, Mr. Brixan,”
said Dicker, the secretary, “but it’s somewhere
above Arundel. Miss Mendoza was here
this morning, asking the same question. She
wanted Miss Leamington to go out to lunch
with her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she did, did she?” said Michael softly.
“Well, if she comes again, you can tell her
from me that Miss Leamington has another
engagement.”</p>

<p>The other nodded wisely.</p>

<p>“I hope she won’t keep you waiting,” he
said. “You never know, when Jack’s on
location——”</p>

<p>“I did not say she had an engagement with
me,” said Michael loudly.</p>

<p>“That reminds me, Mr. Brixan,” said the
secretary suddenly. “Do you remember the
fuss you made—I mean, there was—about a
sheet of manuscript that by some accident had
got into Miss Leamington’s script?”</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“Has the manuscript been found?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No, but the new scenario editor tells me
that he was looking through the book where
Foss kept a record of all the manuscripts that
came in, and he found one entry had been
blacked out with Indian ink.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see that book,” said the
interested Michael, and it was brought to him,
a large foolscap ledger, ruled to show the name
of the submitted scenario, the author, his
address, the date received and the date
returned. Mike put it down on the table in
Knebworth’s private office and went carefully
through the list of authors.</p>

<p>“If he sent one he has probably sent more,”
he said. “There are no other erasures?”</p>

<p>The secretary shook his head.</p>

<p>“That is the only one we’ve seen,” he said.
“You’ll find lots of names of local people—there
isn’t a tradesman in the place who hasn’t
written a scenario or submitted an idea since
we’ve been operating.”</p>

<p>Slowly Michael’s finger went up the column
of names. Page after page was turned back.
And then his finger stopped at an entry.</p>

<p>“The Power of Fear: Sir Gregory Penne,”
he read, and looked round at Dicker.</p>

<p>“Did Sir Gregory submit scenarios, Mr.
Dicker?”</p>

<p>Dicker nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, he sent in one or two,” he said.
“You’ll find his name farther back in the book.
He used to write scenarios which he thought
were suitable for Miss Mendoza. He’s not the
man you’re looking for?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Michael quickly. “Have you
any of his manuscript?”</p>

<p>“They were all sent back,” said Dicker
regretfully. “He wrote awful mush! I read
one of them. I remember Foss trying to
persuade old Jack to produce it. Foss made
quite a lot of money on the side, we’ve
discovered. He used to take fees from
authors, and Mr. Knebworth discovered this
morning that he once took two hundred pounds
from a lady on the promise that he’d get her
into the pictures. He wrote Foss a stinging
letter this morning about it.”</p>

<p>Presently Michael found Sir Gregory’s name
again. It was not remarkable that the owner
of Griff Towers should have submitted a
manuscript. There was hardly a thinking
man or woman in the world who did not believe
he or she was capable of writing for the films.</p>

<p>He closed the book and handed it back to
Dicker.</p>

<p>“It is certainly queer, that erased entry.
I’ll speak to Foss about it as soon as I can find
him,” he said.</p>

<p>He went immediately to the little hotel where
Foss was staying, but he was out.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he came home last night,”
said the manager. “If he did, he didn’t sleep
in his bed. He said he was going to London,”
he added.</p>

<p>Michael went back to the studio, for it had
begun to rain, and he knew that that would
drive the company from location. His surmise
was correct: the big yellow char-à-banc came
rumbling into the yard a few minutes after he
got there. Adele saw him, and was passing
with a nod when he called her to him.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Brixan, but we lunched on
location, and I have two big scenes to read
for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Her refusal was uncompromising, but
Michael was not the type who readily accepted
a “No.”</p>

<p>“What about tea? You’ve got to drink
tea, my good lady, though you have fifty scenes
to study. And you can’t read and eat too.
If you do, you’ll get indigestion, and if you get
indigestion——”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“If my landlady will loan me her parlour,
you may come to tea at half-past four,” she
said; “and if you have another engagement at
five o’clock, you’ll be able to meet it.”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth was waiting for him when
he went into the studio.</p>

<p>“Heard about that entry in the scenario
book?” he asked. “I see you have. What do
you think of it?” Without waiting for a
reply: “It looks queer to me. Foss was an
unmitigated liar. That fellow couldn’t see
straight. I’ve got a little bone to pick with
him on the matter of a fee he accepted from a
screen-struck lady who wished to be featured
in one of my productions.”</p>

<p>“How’s the girl?” asked Michael.</p>

<p>“You mean Adele? Really, she’s wonderful,
Brixan! I’m touching wood all the time”—he
put his hand on the table piously—“because
I know that there’s a big shock
coming to me somewhere and somehow.
Those things do not happen in real life.
The only stars that are born in a night are the
fireworks produced by crazy vice-presidents
who have promised to do something for Mamie
and can’t break their word. And Mamie,
supported by six hundred extras and half a
million dollars’ worth of sets, two chariot races
and the fall of Babylon, all produced regardless
of expense, manages to get over by giving a
fine imitation of what the Queen of Persia
would look like if she’d been born a chorus
girl and trained as a mannequin. And she’s
either got so few clothes that you don’t look at
her face, or so many clothes that you don’t
notice her acting.</p>

<p>“Those kind of stars are like the dust of
the Milky Way: there is so much splendour all
round them that it wouldn’t matter if they
weren’t there at all. But this girl Leamington,
she’s getting over entirely and absolutely by
sheer, unadulterated grey matter. I tell you,
Brixan, it’s not right. These things do not
happen except in the imagination of press
agents. There’s something wrong with that
kid.”</p>

<p>“Wrong?” said Michael, startled.</p>

<p>Knebworth nodded.</p>

<p>“Something radically wrong. There’s a
snag somewhere. She’s either going to let me
down by vanishing before the picture’s through,
or else she’s going to be arrested for driving a
car along Regent Street in a highly intoxicated
condition!”</p>

<p>Michael laughed.</p>

<p>“I think she’ll do neither,” he said.</p>

<p>“Heard about Mendoza’s new company?”
asked old Jack, filling his pipe.</p>

<p>Michael pulled up a chair and sat down.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“She’s starting a new production company.
There’s never a star I’ve fired that hasn’t! It
gets all written out on paper, capital in big type,
star in bigger! It’s generally due to the friends
of the star, who tell her that a hundred thousand
a year is a cruel starvation wage for a woman
of her genius, and she ought to get it all.
Generally there’s a sucker in the background
who puts up the money. As a rule, he puts up
all but enough, and then she selects a story
where she is never off the screen, and wears a
new dress every fifty feet of film. If she
can’t find that sort of story, why, she gets
somebody to write her one. The only time
you ever see the other members of the company
is in the long shots. Half-way through the
picture the money dries up, the company goes
bust, and all the poor little star gets out of
it is the Rolls-Royce she bought to take her on
location, the new bungalow she built to be
nearer the lot, and about twenty-five per cent.
of the capital that she’s taken on account of
royalties.”</p>

<p>“Mendoza will not get a good producer in
England?”</p>

<p>“She may,” nodded Jack. “There <em>are</em>
producers in this country, but unfortunately
they’re not the men on top. They’ve been
brought down by the craze for greatness. A
man who produces with a lot of capital behind
him can get easy money. He doesn’t go after
the domestic stories, where he’d be found out
first time; he says to the money-bags: ‘Let’s
produce the Fall of Jerusalem. I’ve got a
cute idea for building Ezekiel’s temple that’s
never been taken before. It’ll only cost a mere
trifle of two hundred thousand dollars, and we’ll
have five thousand extras in one scene, and
we’ll rebuild the Colosseum and have a hundred
real lions in the arena! Story? What do
you want a story for? The public love
crowds.’ Or maybe he wants to build a new
Vesuvius and an eruption at the rate of fifty
dollars a foot. There’s many a big reputation
been built up on sets and extras. Come in,
Mr. Longvale.”</p>

<p>Michael turned. The cheery old man was at
the door, hat in hand.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I am rather a nuisance,” he
said in his beautiful voice. “But I came in
to see my lawyer, and I could not deny myself
the satisfaction of calling to see how your
picture is progressing.”</p>

<p>“It is going on well, Mr. Longvale, thank
you,” said Jack. “You know Mr. Brixan?”</p>

<p>The old man nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>“Yes, I came in to see my lawyer on what
to you will seem to be a curious errand. Many
years ago I was a medical student and took my
final examination, so that I am, to all intents
and purposes, a doctor, though I’ve not
practised to any extent. It is not generally
known that I have a medical degree and I was
surprised last night to be called out by—er—a
neighbour, who wished me to attend a servant
of his. Now, I am so hazy on the subject that
I wasn’t quite sure whether or not I’d broken
the law by practising without registration.”</p>

<p>“I can relieve your mind there, Mr.
Longvale,” said Michael. “Once you are
registered, you are always registered, and you
acted quite within your rights.”</p>

<p>“So my lawyer informed me,” said Longvale
gravely.</p>

<p>“Was it a bad case?” asked Michael, who
guessed who the patient was.</p>

<p>“No, it was not a bad case. I thought there
was blood poisoning, but I think perhaps I may
have been mistaken. Medical science has
made such great advance since I was a young
man that I almost feared to prescribe. Whilst
I am only too happy to render any service that
humanity demands, I must confess that it was
rather a disturbing experience, and I scarcely
slept all night. In fact, it was a very disturbing
evening and night. Somebody, for some
extraordinary reason, put a motor-bicycle in my
garden.”</p>

<p>Michael smiled to himself.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand why. It had gone
this morning. And then I saw our friend
Foss, who seemed very much perturbed about
something.”</p>

<p>“Where did you see him?” asked Michael
quickly.</p>

<p>“He was passing my house. I was standing
at the gate, smoking my pipe, and bade him
good night without knowing who he was.
When he turned back, I saw it was Mr. Foss.
He told me he had been to make a call,
and that he had another appointment in an
hour.”</p>

<p>“What time was this?” asked Michael.</p>

<p>“I think it must have been eleven o’clock.”
The old man hesitated. “I’m not sure. It
was just before I went to bed.”</p>

<p>Michael could easily account for Foss’s
conduct. Sir Gregory had hurried him off and
told him to come back after the girl had gone.</p>

<p>“My little place used to be remarkable for
its quietness,” said Mr. Longvale, and shook
his head. “Perhaps,” turning to Knebworth,
“when your picture is finished you will be so
good as to allow me to see it?”</p>

<p>“Why, surely, Mr. Longvale.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I’m taking this
tremendous interest,” chuckled the old man.
“I must confess that, until a few weeks ago,
film-making was a mystery to me. And even
to-day it belongs to the esoteric sciences.”</p>

<p>Dicker thrust his head in the door.</p>

<p>“Will you see Miss Mendoza?” he asked.</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth’s expression was one of
utter weariness.</p>

<p>“No,” he said curtly.</p>

<p>“She says——” began Dicker.</p>

<p>Only the presence of the venerable Mr.
Longvale prevented Jack from expressing his
views on Stella Mendoza and all that she could
say.</p>

<p>“There’s another person I saw last night,”
nodded Mr. Longvale. “I thought at first you
must be shooting—is that the expression?—in
the neighbourhood, but Mr. Foss told me that
I was mistaken. She’s rather a charming
girl, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Very,” said Jack dryly.</p>

<p>“A very sweet disposition,” Longvale went
on, unconscious of the utter lack of sympathy in
the atmosphere. “Nowadays, the confusion
and hurry which modernity brings in its trail do
not make for sweetness of temper, and one is
glad to meet an exception. Not that I am an
enemy of modernity. To me, this is the most
delightful phase of my long life.”</p>

<p>“Sweet disposition!” almost howled Jack
Knebworth when the old man had taken a
dignified farewell. “Did you get that, Brixan?
Say, if that woman’s disposition is sweet, the
devil’s made of chocolate!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch22'>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE HEAD</span></h1></div>

<p>When Mike went out, he found Stella at the
gate of the studio, and remembered, seeing
her, that she had been invited to lunch at
Griff Towers. To his surprise she crossed the
road to him.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you, Mr. Brixan,” she said.
“I sent in word to find if you were there.”</p>

<p>“Then your message was wrongly delivered
to Mr. Knebworth,” smiled Mike.</p>

<p>She lifted one of her shoulders in demonstration
of her contempt for Jack Knebworth and
all his works.</p>

<p>“No, it was you I wanted to see. You’re a
detective, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Michael, wondering what was
coming next.</p>

<p>“My car is round the corner: will you come
to my house?”</p>

<p>Michael hesitated. He was anxious, more
than anxious, to speak to Adele, though he had
nothing special to tell her, beyond the thing
which he himself did not know and she could
never guess.</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” he said.</p>

<p>She was a skilful motorist, and apparently so
much engrossed in her driving that she did not
speak throughout the journey. In the pretty
little drawing-room from which he had a view
of the lovely South Downs, he waited
expectantly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Brixan, I am going to tell you something
which I think you ought to know.”</p>

<p>Her face was pale, her manner curiously
nervous.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you will think of me
when I have told you, but I’ve got to risk that.
I can’t keep silence any longer.”</p>

<p>A shrill bell sounded in the hall.</p>

<p>“The telephone. Will you excuse me one
moment?”</p>

<p>She hurried out, leaving the door slightly
ajar. Michael heard her quick, angry reply
to somebody at the other end of the wire, and
then a long interregnum of silence, when
apparently she listened without comment. It
was nearly ten minutes before she returned,
and her eyes were bright and her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>“Would you mind if I told you what I was
going to tell you a little later?” she asked.</p>

<p>She had been on the telephone to Sir
Gregory: of that Michael was sure, though she
had not mentioned his name.</p>

<p>“There’s no time like the present, Miss
Mendoza,” he said encouragingly, and she
licked her dry lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but there are reasons why
I can’t speak now. Would you see me
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” said Michael, secretly
glad of his release.</p>

<p>“Shall I drive you back?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, I can walk.”</p>

<p>“Let me take you to the edge of the town:
I’m going that way,” she begged.</p>

<p>Of course she was going that way, thought
Michael. She was going to Griff Towers. He
was so satisfied on this matter that he did not
even trouble to inquire, and when she dropped
him at his hotel, she hardly waited for him to
step to the side-walk before the car leapt forward
on its way.</p>

<p>“There’s a telegram for you, sir,” said the
porter. He went into the manager’s office and
returned with a buff envelope, which Michael
tore open.</p>

<p>For a time he could not comprehend the
fateful message the telegram conveyed. And
then slowly he read it to himself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A head found on Chobham Common early
this morning. Come to Leatherhead Police
Station at once.</p>

<p>“Staines.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An hour later a fast car dropped him before
the station. Staines was waiting on the step.</p>

<p>“Found at daybreak this morning,” he said.
“The man is so far unknown.”</p>

<p>He led the way to an outhouse. On a table
in the centre of the room was a box, and he
lifted the lid.</p>

<p>Mike took one glance at the waxen face and
turned white.</p>

<p>“Good God!” he breathed.</p>

<p>It was the head of Lawley Foss.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch23'>CHAPTER XXIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CLUES AT THE TOWER</span></h1></div>

<p>Michael gazed in fascinated horror at the
tragic spectacle. Then reverently he covered
the box with a cloth and walked out into the
paved courtyard.</p>

<p>“You know him?” asked Staines.</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is Lawley Foss, lately scenario
editor of the Knebworth Picture Corporation.
He was seen alive last night at eleven o’clock.
I myself heard, if I did not see him, somewhere
about that time. He was visiting Griff Towers,
Sir Gregory Penne’s place in Sussex. Was
there the usual note?” he asked.</p>

<p>“There was a note, but it was quite unusual.”</p>

<p>He showed the typewritten slip: it was in
the station inspector’s office. One characteristic
line, with its ill-aligned letters.</p>

<p>“This is the head of a traitor.” That and
no more.</p>

<p>“I’ve had the Dorking police on the ’phone.
It was a wet night, and although several cars
passed none of them could be identified.”</p>

<p>“Has the advertisement appeared?” asked
Michael.</p>

<p>Staines shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, that was the first thing we thought of.
The newspapers have carefully observed, and
every newspaper manager in the country has
promised to notify us the moment such an
advertisement is inserted. But there has been
no ad. of any suspicious character.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to follow the line of probability
here,” said Michael. “It is clear that this
man was murdered between eleven o’clock and
three in the morning—probably nearer eleven
than three; for if the murderer is located in
Sussex, he would have to bring the head to
Chobham, leave it in the dark and return before
it was light.”</p>

<p>His car took Michael back to Chichester at
racing pace. Short of the city he turned
off the main road, his objective being Griff
Towers. It was late when he arrived, and
the Towers presented its usual lifeless appearance.
He rang the bell, but there was no
immediate reply. He rang again, and then the
voice of Sir Gregory hailed him from one of
the upper windows.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>He went out of the porch and looked up.
Sir Gregory Penne did not recognize him in
the darkness, and called again:</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” and followed this with a
phrase which Michael guessed was Malayan.</p>

<p>“It is I, Michael Brixan. I want to see
you, Penne.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Come down and I will tell you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve gone to bed for the night. See me in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see you now,” said Michael firmly. “I
have a warrant to search this house.”</p>

<p>He had no such warrant, but only because
he had not asked for one.</p>

<p>The man’s head was hastily withdrawn, the
window slammed down, and such a long
interval passed that Michael thought that the
baronet intended denying him admission.
This view, however, was wrong. At the end of
a dreary period of waiting the door was opened,
and, in the light of the hall lamp, Sir Gregory
Penne presented an extraordinary appearance.</p>

<p>He was fully dressed: around his waist were
belted two heavy revolvers, but this fact
Michael did not immediately notice. The
man’s head was swathed in bandages; only
one eye was visible; his left arm was stiff
with a surgical dressing, and he limped as he
walked.</p>

<p>“I’ve had an accident,” he said gruffly.</p>

<p>“It looks a pretty bad one,” said Michael,
observing him narrowly.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to talk here: come into my
room,” growled the man.</p>

<p>In Sir Gregory’s library there were signs of
a struggle. A long mirror which hung on one
of the walls was shattered to pieces; and,
looking up, Michael saw that one of the two
swords was missing.</p>

<p>“You’ve lost something,” he said. “Did
that occur in course of the ‘accident’?”</p>

<p>Sir Gregory nodded.</p>

<p>Something in the hang of the second sword
attracted Michael’s attention, and, without
asking permission, he lifted it down from its
hook and drew the blade from the scabbard. It
was brown with blood.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this?” he asked
sternly.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory swallowed something.</p>

<p>“A fellow broke into the house last night,”
he said slowly, “a Malayan fellow. He had
some cock and bull story about my having
carried off his wife. He attacked me, and
naturally I defended myself.”</p>

<p>“And had you carried off his wife?” asked
Michael.</p>

<p>The baronet shrugged.</p>

<p>“The idea is absurd. Most of these Borneo
folk are mad, and they’ll run amok on the
slightest provocation. I did my best to pacify
him——”</p>

<p>Michael looked at the stained sword.</p>

<p>“So I see,” he said dryly. “And did you—pacify
him?”</p>

<p>“I defended myself, if that’s what you mean.
I returned him almost as good as he gave.
You don’t expect me to sit down and be
murdered in my own house, do you? I can
use a sword as well as any man.”</p>

<p>“And apparently you used it,” said Michael.
“What happened to Foss?”</p>

<p>Not a muscle of Penne’s face moved.</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean Lawley Foss, who was in your house
last night.”</p>

<p>“You mean the scenario writer? I haven’t
seen him for weeks.”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar,” said Michael calmly. “He
was in here last night. I can assure you
on this point, because I was in the next
room.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was you, was it?” said the baronet,
and seemed relieved. “Yes, he came to
borrow money. I let him have fifty pounds,
and he went away, and that’s the last I saw
of him.”</p>

<p>Michael looked at the sword again.</p>

<p>“Would you be surprised to learn that Foss’s
head has been picked up on Chobham
Common?” he asked.</p>

<p>The other turned a pair of cold, searching
eyes upon his interrogator.</p>

<p>“I should be very much surprised,” he said
coolly. “If necessary, I have a witness to
prove that Foss went, though I don’t like
bringing in a lady’s name. Miss Stella
Mendoza was here, having a bit of supper, as
you probably know, if it was you in the next
room. He left before she did.”</p>

<p>“And he returned,” said Michael.</p>

<p>“I never saw him again, I tell you,” said the
baronet violently. “If you can find anybody
who saw him come into this house after his first
visit you can arrest me. Do you think <em>I</em> killed
him?”</p>

<p>Michael did not answer.</p>

<p>“There was a woman upstairs in the tower.
What has become of her?”</p>

<p>The other wetted his lips before he replied.</p>

<p>“The only woman in the tower was a sick
servant: she has gone.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see for myself,” said Michael.</p>

<p>Only for a second did the man cast his eyes
in the direction of Bhag’s den, and then:</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “Follow me.”</p>

<p>He went out into the corridor and turned,
not toward the hall but in the opposite direction.
Ten paces farther down he stopped and opened
a door, so cunningly set in the panelling, and
so placed between the two shaded lights that
illuminated the corridor, that it was difficult to
detect its presence. He put in his hand, turned
on a light, and Michael saw a long flight of
stairs leading back toward the hall.</p>

<p>As he followed the baronet, he realized that
the “tower” was something of an illusion. It
was only a tower if viewed from the front of
the house. Otherwise it was an additional
two narrow storeys built on one wing of the
building.</p>

<p>They passed through a door, up a circular
staircase, and came to the corridor where
Michael had seen Bhag squatting on the
previous night.</p>

<p>“This is the room,” said Penne, opening a
door.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch24'>CHAPTER XXIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE MARKS OF THE BEAST</span></h1></div>

<p>“On the contrary, it is not the room,” said
Michael quietly. “The room is at the end of
the passage.”</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>“Can’t you believe me?” he asked in an
almost affable tone of voice. “What a sceptical
chap you are! Now come, Brixan! I don’t
want to be bad friends with you. Let’s go
down and have a drink and forget our past
animosities. I’m feeling rotten——”</p>

<p>“I want to see that room,” said Michael.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the key.”</p>

<p>“Then get it,” said Michael sharply.</p>

<p>Eventually the baronet found a pass-key in
his pocket, and, with every sign of reluctance,
he opened the door.</p>

<p>“She went away in a bit of a hurry,” he said.
“She was taken so ill that I had to get rid of
her.”</p>

<p>“If she left here because she was ill she
went into an institution of some kind, the name
of which you will be able to give me,” said
Michael, as he turned on the light.</p>

<p>One glance at the room told him that the
story of her hasty departure may have been
accurate. But that the circumstances were
normal, the appearance of the room denied.
The bed was in confusion; there was blood on
the pillow, and a dark brown stain on the wall.
A chair was broken; the carpet had odd and
curious stains, one like the print of a bare foot.
On a sheet was an indubitable hand-print, but
such a hand as no human being had ever
possessed.</p>

<p>“The mark of the beast,” said Michael,
pointing. “That’s Bhag!”</p>

<p>Again the baronet licked his lips.</p>

<p>“There was a bit of a fight here,” he said.
“The man came up and pretended to identify
the servant as his wife——”</p>

<p>“What happened to him?”</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>“What happened to him?” asked Michael
with ominous patience.</p>

<p>“I let him go, and let him take the woman
with him. It was easier——”</p>

<p>With a sudden exclamation, Michael stooped
and picked up from behind the bed a bright
steel object. It was the half of a sword,
snapped clean in the middle, and unstained.
He looked along the blade, and presently found
the slightest indent. Picking up the chair, he
examined the leg and found two deeper dents
in one of the legs.</p>

<p>“I’ll reconstruct the scene. You and your
Bhag caught the man after he had got into this
room. The chair was broken in the struggle,
probably by Bhag, who used the chair. The
man escaped from the room, ran downstairs into
the library and got the sword from the wall,
then came up after you. That’s when the real
fighting started. I guess some of this blood
is yours, Penne.”</p>

<p>“Some of it!” snarled the other. “All of
it, damn him!”</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>“Did the woman leave this room—alive?”</p>

<p>“I believe so,” said the other sullenly.</p>

<p>“Did her husband leave your library—alive?”</p>

<p>“You’d better find that out. So far as I
know—I was unconscious for half an hour.
Bhag can use a sword——”</p>

<p>Michael did not leave the house till he had
searched it from attic to basement. He had
every servant assembled and began his interrogation.
Each of them except one spoke
Dutch, but none spoke the language to such
purpose that they made him any wiser than he
had been.</p>

<p>Going back to the library, he put on all the
lights.</p>

<p>“I’ll see Bhag,” he said.</p>

<p>“He’s out, I tell you. If you don’t believe
me——” Penne went to the desk and turned
the switch. The door opened and nothing
came out.</p>

<p>A moment’s hesitation and Michael had
penetrated into the den, a revolver in one hand,
his lamp in another. The two rooms were
scrupulously clean, though a strange animal
smell pervaded everything. There was a small
bed, with sheets and blankets and feather
pillow, where the beast slept; a small larder,
full of nuts; a running water tap (he found
afterwards that, in spite of his cleverness, Bhag
was incapable of turning on or off a faucet); a
deep, well-worn settee, where the dumb servitor
took his rest; and three cricket balls, which
were apparently the playthings of this hideous
animal.</p>

<p>Bhag’s method of entering and leaving the
house was now apparent. His exit was a
square opening in the wall, with neither window
nor curtain, which was situated about seven feet
from the ground; and two projecting steel
rungs, set at intervals between the window and
the floor, made a sort of ladder. Michael found
corresponding rungs on the garden side of the
wall.</p>

<p>There was no sign of blood, no evidence
that Bhag had taken any part in the terrible
scene which must have been enacted the night
before.</p>

<p>Going back to the library, he made a diligent
search, but found nothing until he went into
the little drawing-room where he had hidden
the night before. Here on the window-sill he
found traces enough. The mark of a bare
foot, and another which suggested that a heavy
body had been dragged through the window.</p>

<p>By this time his chauffeur, who, after dropping
him at Griff Towers, went on to Chichester,
had returned with the two police officers, and
they assisted him in a further search of the
grounds. The trail of the fugitive was easy to
follow: there were bloodstains across the gravel,
broken plants in a circular flower-bed, the soft
loam of which had received the impression of
those small bare feet. In the vegetable field
the trail was lost.</p>

<p>“The question is, who carried whom?” said
Inspector Lyle, after Michael, in a few words,
had told him all that he had learnt at the Towers.
“It looks to me as if these people were killed
in the house and their bodies carried away by
Bhag. There’s no trace of blood in his room,
which means no more than that in all probability
he hasn’t been there since the killing,” said
Inspector Lyle. “If we find the monkey we’ll
solve this little mystery. Penne is the Head-Hunter,
of course,” the Inspector went on. “I
had a talk with him the other day, and there’s
something fanatical about the man.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure,” said Michael slowly,
“that you’re right. Perhaps my ideas are just
a little bizarre; but if Sir Gregory Penne is the
actual murderer, I shall be a very surprised
man. I admit,” he confessed, “that the
absence of any footprints in Bhag’s quarters
staggered me, and probably your theory is
correct. There is nothing to be done but to
keep the house under observation until I
communicate with headquarters.”</p>

<p>At this moment the second detective, who
had been searching the field to its farthermost
boundary, came back to say that he had picked
up the trail again near the postern gate, which
was open. They hurried across the field and
found proof of his discovery. There was a
trail both inside and outside the gate. Near
the postern was a big heap of leaves, which had
been left by the gardener to rot, and on this
they found the impression of a body, as though
whoever was the carrier had put his burden
down for a little while to rest. In the field
beyond the gate, however, the trail was
definitely lost.</p>

<p>Life is largely made up of little things, but
perspective in human affairs is not a gift
common to youth. It had required a great
effort on the part of Adele Leamington to ask
a man to tea, but, once that effort was made,
she had looked forward with a curious pleasure
to the function.</p>

<p>At the moment Michael was speeding to
London, she interviewed Jack Knebworth in
his holy of holies.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear: you may take the
afternoon off. I am not quite sure what the
schedule was.”</p>

<p>He reached out his hand for the written
time-table, but she supplied the information.</p>

<p>“You wanted some studio portraits of me—‘stills,’ ”
she said.</p>

<p>“So I did! Well, that can wait. Are
you feeling pretty confident about the picture,
eh?”</p>

<p>“I? No, I’m not confident, Mr.
Knebworth; I’m in a state of nerves about it.
You see, it doesn’t seem possible that I should
make good at the first attempt. One dreams
about such things, but in dreams it is easy
to jump obstacles and get round dangerous
corners and slur over difficulties. Every time
you call ‘camera!’ I am in a state of panic,
and I am so self-conscious that I am watching
every movement I take, and saying to myself
‘You’re raising your hands awkwardly; you’re
turning your head with a jerk.’ ”</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t last?” he said sharply,
so sharply that she smiled.</p>

<p>“No: the moment I hear the camera
turning, I feel that I <em>am</em> the character I’m
supposed to be.”</p>

<p>He patted her on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“That is how you <em>should</em> feel,” he said, and
went on: “Seen nothing of Mendoza, have
you? She isn’t annoying you? Or Foss?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not seen Miss Mendoza for days—but
I saw Mr. Foss last night.”</p>

<p>She did not explain the curious circumstances,
and Jack Knebworth was so incurious
that he did not ask. So that he learnt nothing
of Lawley Foss’s mysterious interview with the
man in the closed car at the corner of
Arundel Road, an incident she had witnessed
on the previous night. Nor of the white and
womanly hand that had waved him farewell,
nor of the great diamond which had sparkled
lustrously on the little finger of the unknown
motorist.</p>

<p>Going home, Adele stopped at a confectioner’s
and a florist’s, collected the cakes and
flowers that were to adorn the table of Mrs.
Watson’s parlour. She wondered more than
a little just what attraction she offered to
this man of affairs. She had a trick of getting
outside and examining herself with an
impartial eye, and she knew that, by self-repression
and almost self-obliteration, she
had succeeded in making of Adele Leamington
a very colourless, characterless young lady.
That she was pretty she knew, but prettiness
in itself attracts only the superficial. Men
who are worth knowing require something
more than beauty. And Michael was not
philandering—he was not that kind. He
wanted her for a friend at least: she had no
thought that he desired amusement during his
enforced stay in a very dull town.</p>

<p>Half-past four came and found the girl
waiting. At a quarter to five she was at the
door, scanning the street. At five, angry but
philosophical, she had her tea and ordered the
little maid of all work to clear the table.</p>

<p>Michael had forgotten!</p>

<p>Of course, she made excuses for him, only
to demolish them and build again. She was
hurt, amused and hurt again. Going upstairs
to her room, she lit the gas, took the script
from her bag and tried to study the scenes
that were to be shot on the following day, but
all manner of distractions interposed between
her receptive mind and the typewritten paper.
Michael bulked largely, and the closed car,
and Lawley Foss, and that waving white hand
as the car drove off. Curiously enough, her
speculations came back again and again to the
car. It was new and its woodwork was highly
polished and it moved so noiselessly.</p>

<p>At last she threw the manuscript down and
rose, with a doubtful eye on the bed. She
was not tired; the hour was nine. Chichester
offered few attractions by night. There were
two cinemas, and she was not in the mood
for cinemas. She put on her hat and went
down, calling en route at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“I am going out for a quarter of an hour,”
she told her landlady, who was in an
approving mood.</p>

<p>The house was situate in a street of small
villas. It was economically illuminated, and
there were dark patches where the light of the
street lamps scarcely reached. In one of
these a motor-car was standing—she saw the
bulk of it before she identified its character.
She wondered if the owner knew that its tail
light was extinguished. As she came up to
the machine she identified the car she had
seen on the previous night—Foss had spoken
to its occupant.</p>

<p>Glancing to the left, she could see nothing
of its interior. The blinds on the road side
were drawn, and she thought it was empty,
and then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“Pretty lady—come with me!”</p>

<p>The voice was a whisper: she caught the
flash and sparkle of a precious stone, saw the
white hand on the edge of the half-closed
window, and, in a fit of unreasoning terror,
hurried forward.</p>

<p>She heard a whirr of electric starter and the
purring of engines. The machine was following
her, and she broke into a run. At the
corner of the street she saw a man and flew
toward him, as she made out the helmet of a
policeman.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, miss?”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the car flashed past, spun
round the corner and was out of sight
instantly.</p>

<p>“A man spoke to me—in that car,” she
said breathlessly.</p>

<p>The stolid constable gazed vacantly at the
place where the car had been.</p>

<p>“He didn’t have lights,” he said stupidly.
“I ought to have taken his number. Did he
insult you, miss?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, for she was already
ashamed of her fears.</p>

<p>“I’m nervy, officer,” she said with a smile.
“I don’t think I will go any farther.”</p>

<p>She turned back and hurried to her lodgings.
There were disadvantages in starring—even
on Jack Knebworth’s modest lot. It was
nervous work, she thought.</p>

<p>She went to sleep that night and dreamt
that the man in the car was Michael Brixan
and he wanted her to come in to tea.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when Michael rang
up Jack Knebworth with the news.</p>

<p>“Foss!” he gasped. “Good God! You
don’t mean that, Brixan? Shall I come round
and see you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll come to you,” said Michael. “There
are one or two things I want to know about the
man, and it will create less of a fuss than if I
have to admit you to the hotel.”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth rented a house on the
Arundel Road, and he was waiting at the
garden door to admit his visitor when Michael
arrived.</p>

<p>Michael told the story of the discovery of
the head, and felt that he might so far take
the director into his confidence as to retail his
visit to Sir Gregory Penne.</p>

<p>“That beats everything,” said Jack in a
hushed tone. “Poor old Foss! You think
that Penne did this? But why? You don’t
cut up a man because he wants to borrow
money.”</p>

<p>“My views have been switching round a
little,” said Michael. “You remember a
sheet of manuscript that was found amongst
some of your script, and which I told you must
have been written by the Head-Hunter?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly sure,” Michael went on,
“and particularly after seeing the erasure in
the scenario book, that Foss knew who was the
author of that manuscript, and I’m equally
certain that he resolved upon the desperate
expedient of blackmailing the writer. If that
is the case, and if Sir Gregory is the man—again
I am very uncertain on this point—there
is a good reason why he should be put
out of the way. There is one person who can
help us, and that is——”</p>

<p>“Mendoza,” said Jack, and the two men’s
eyes met.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch26'>CHAPTER XXVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE HAND</span></h1></div>

<p>Jack looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“I guess she’ll be in bed by now, but it’s
worth while trying. Would you like to see
her?”</p>

<p>Michael hesitated. Stella Mendoza was a
friend of Penne’s, and he was loath to commit
himself irretrievably to the view that Penne
was the murderer.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we’ll see her,” he said.
“After all, Penne knows that he is suspected.”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth was ten minutes on the
telephone before he succeeded in getting a
reply from Stella’s cottage.</p>

<p>“It’s Knebworth speaking, Miss Mendoza,”
he said. “Is it possible to see you to-night?
Mr. Brixan wants to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“At this hour of the night?” she said in
sleepy surprise. “I was in bed when the bell
rang. Won’t it do in the morning?”</p>

<p>“No, he wants to see you particularly
to-night. I’ll come along with him if you
don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“What is wrong?” she asked quickly. “Is
it about Gregory?”</p>

<p>Jack whispered a query to the man who
stood at his side, and Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is about Gregory,” said Knebworth.</p>

<p>“Will you come along? I’ll have time to
dress.”</p>

<p>Stella was dressed by the time they arrived,
and too curious and too alarmed to make the
hour of the call a matter of comment.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Foss is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead?” She opened her eyes wide.
“Why, I only saw him yesterday. But
how?”</p>

<p>“He has been murdered,” said Michael
quietly. “His head has been found on
Chobham Common.”</p>

<p>She would have fallen to the floor, had not
Michael’s arm been there to support her,
and it was some time before she recovered
sufficiently to answer coherently the questions
which were put to her.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t see Mr. Foss again after he
left the Towers, and then I only saw him for a
few seconds.”</p>

<p>“Did he suggest he was coming back
again?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Did Sir Gregory tell you he was
returning?”</p>

<p>“No.” She shook her head again. “He
told me he was glad to see the last of him,
and that he had borrowed fifty pounds until
next week, when he expected to make a lot of
money. Gregory is like that—he will tell
you things about people, things which they
ask him not to make public. He is rather
proud of his wealth and what he calls his
charity.”</p>

<p>“You had a luncheon engagement with
him?” said Michael, watching her.</p>

<p>She bit her lip.</p>

<p>“You must have heard me talking when I
left him,” she said. “No, I had no luncheon
engagement. That was camouflage, intended
for anybody who was hanging around, and we
knew somebody had been in the house that
night. Was it you?”</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so relieved!” She heaved a
deep sigh. “Those few minutes in that dark
room were terrible to me. I thought it
was——” She hesitated.</p>

<p>“Bhag?” suggested Michael, and she
nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes. You don’t suspect Gregory of
killing Foss?”</p>

<p>“I suspect everybody in general and nobody
in particular,” said Michael. “Did you see
Bhag?”</p>

<p>She shivered.</p>

<p>“No, not that time. I’ve seen him, of
course. He gives me the creeps! I’ve never
seen anything so human. Sometimes, when
Gregory was a little—a little drunk, he used
to bring Bhag out and make him do tricks.
Do you know that Bhag could do all the
Malayan exercises with the sword! Sir
Gregory had a specially made wooden sword
for him, and the way that that awful thing
used to twirl it round his head was terrifying.”</p>

<p>Michael stared at her.</p>

<p>“Bhag <em>could</em> use the sword, then? Penne
told me he did, but I thought he was
lying.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he could use the sword. Gregory
taught him everything.”</p>

<p>“What is Penne to you?” Michael asked
the question bluntly, and she coloured.</p>

<p>“He has been a friend,” she said awkwardly,
“a very good friend of mine—financially,
I mean. He took a liking to me a long
time ago, and we’ve been—very good
friends.”</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“And you are still?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered shortly, “I’ve finished
with Gregory, and am leaving Chichester
to-morrow. I’ve put the house in an agent’s
hands to rent. Poor Mr. Foss!” she said,
and there were tears in her eyes. “Poor
soul! Gregory wouldn’t have done it, Mr.
Brixan, I’ll swear that! There’s a whole lot
of Gregory that’s sheer bluff. He’s a coward
at heart, and though he has done dreadful
things, he has always had an agent to do the
dirty work.”</p>

<p>“Dreadful things like what?”</p>

<p>She seemed reluctant to explain, but he
pressed her.</p>

<p>“Well, he told me that he used to take
expeditions in the bush and raid the villages,
carrying off girls. There is one tribe that have
very beautiful women. Perhaps he was lying
about that too, but I have an idea that he
spoke the truth. He told me that only a
year ago, when he was in Borneo, he ‘lifted’
a girl from a wild village where it was death
for a European to go. He always said
‘lifted.’ ”</p>

<p>“And didn’t you mind these confessions?”
asked Michael, his steely eye upon her.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“He was that kind of man,” was all she
said, and it spoke volumes for her understanding
of her “very good friend.”</p>

<p>Michael walked back to Jack Knebworth’s
house.</p>

<p>“The story Penne tells seems to fit together
with the information Mendoza has given us.
There is no doubt that the woman at the top
of the tower was the lady he ‘lifted,’ and less
doubt that the little brown man was her
husband. If they have escaped from the
tower, then there should be no difficulty in
finding them. I’ll send out a message to all
stations within a radius of twenty-five miles,
and we ought to get news of them in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“It’s morning now,” said Jack, looking
toward the greying east. “Will you come
in? I’ll give you some coffee. This news
has upset me. I was going to have a long
day’s work, but I guess we’ll have to put it off
for a day or so. The company is bound to be
upset by this news. They all knew Foss,
although he was not very popular with them.
It only wants Adele to be off colour to
complete our misery. By the way, Brixan,
why don’t you make this your headquarters?
I’m a bachelor; there’s a ’phone service here,
and you’ll get a privacy at this house which
you don’t get at your hotel.”</p>

<p>The idea appealed to the detective, and it
was at Jack Knebworth’s house that he slept
that night, after an hour’s conversation on the
telephone with Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Early in the morning he was again at the
Towers, and now, with the assistance of daylight,
he enlarged his search, without adding
greatly to his knowledge. The position was
a peculiar one, as Scotland Yard had
emphasized. Sir Gregory Penne was a
member of a good family, a rich man, a
justice of the peace; and, whilst his
eccentricities were of a lawless character,
“you can’t hang people for being queer,”
the Commissioner informed Michael on the
telephone.</p>

<p>It was a suspicious fact that Bhag had
disappeared as completely as the brown man
and his wife.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been back all night: I’ve seen
nothing of him,” said Sir Gregory. “And
that’s not the first time he’s gone off on his
own. He finds hiding-places that you’d never
suspect, and he’s probably gone to earth
somewhere. He’ll turn up.”</p>

<p>Michael was passing through Chichester
when he saw a figure that made him bring the
car to a standstill with such a jerk that it was
a wonder the tyres did not burst. In a
second he was out of the machine and walking
to meet Adele.</p>

<p>“It seems ten thousand years since I saw
you,” he said with an extravagance which at
any other time would have brought a smile to
her face.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t stop. I’m on my way
to the studio,” she said, a little coldly, “and
I promised Mr. Knebworth that I would be
there early. You see, I got off yesterday
afternoon by telling Mr. Knebworth that I had
an engagement.”</p>

<p>“And had you?” asked the innocent
Michael.</p>

<p>“I asked somebody to take tea with me,”
and his jaw dropped.</p>

<p>“Moses!” he gasped. “I am the villain!”</p>

<p>She would have gone on, but he stopped
her.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to shock you or hurt you,
Adele,” he said gently, “but the explanation
for my forgetfulness is that we’ve had another
tragedy.”</p>

<p>She stopped and looked at him.</p>

<p>“Another?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Mr. Foss has been murdered,” he said.</p>

<p>She went very white.</p>

<p>“When?” Her voice was calm, almost
emotionless.</p>

<p>“Last night.”</p>

<p>“It was after nine,” she said.</p>

<p>His eyebrows went up in surprise.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“Because, Mr. Brixan”—she spoke slowly—“at
nine o’clock I saw the hand of the man
who murdered him!</p>

<p>“Two nights ago,” she went on, “I went
out to buy some wool I wanted. It was just
before the shops closed—a quarter to eight, I
think. In the town I saw Mr. Foss and spoke
to him. He was very nervous and restless,
and again made a suggestion to me which he
had already made when he called on me.
His manner was so strange that I asked him
if he was in any trouble. He told me no, but
he had had an awful premonition that something
dreadful was going to happen, and he
asked me if I’d lived in Chichester for any
length of time, and if I knew about the caves.”</p>

<p>“The caves?” said Michael quickly.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“I was surprised. I’d never heard of the
caves. He told me there was a reference to
them in some old history of Chichester. He
had looked in the guide-books without finding
anything about them, but apparently there
were caves at some time or other near
Chellerton, but there was a heavy subsidence
of earth that closed the entrance. He was so
rambling and so disjointed that I thought he
must have been drinking, and I was glad to
get away from him. I went on and did my
shopping and met one of the extra girls I
knew. She asked me to go home with her.
I didn’t want to go a bit, but I thought if I
refused she would think I was giving myself
airs, and so I went. As soon as I could, I
came away and went straight home.</p>

<p>“It was then nine o’clock and the streets
were empty. They are not very well lit in
Chichester, but I was able to recognize Mr.
Foss. He was standing at the corner of the
Arundel Road, and was evidently waiting for
somebody. I stopped because I particularly
did not wish to meet Mr. Foss, but I was on
the point of turning round when a car drove
into the road and stopped almost opposite
him.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a car?” asked Michael.</p>

<p>“It was a closed landaulette—I think they
call them sedans. As it came round the
corner its lights went out, which struck me
as being curious. Mr. Foss was evidently
waiting for this, for he went up and leant on
the edge of the window and spoke to somebody
inside. I don’t know what made me do it, but
I had an extraordinary impulse to see who was
in the car, and I started walking toward them.
I must have been five or six yards away when
Mr. Foss stepped back and the sedan moved
on. The driver put his hand out of the
window as if he was waving good-bye. It was
still out of the window and the only thing
visible—the interior was quite dark—when it
came abreast of me.”</p>

<p>“Was there anything peculiar about the
hand?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that it was small and
white, and on the little finger was a large
diamond ring. The fire in it was extraordinary,
and I wondered why a man should
wear a ring of that kind. You will think I
am silly, but the sight of that hand gave me a
terrible feeling of fear—I don’t know why,
even now. There was something unnatural
and abnormal about it. When I looked
round again, Mr. Foss was walking rapidly in
the other direction, and I made no attempt to
overtake him.”</p>

<p>“You saw no number on the car?”</p>

<p>“None whatever.” She shook her head.
“I wasn’t so curious.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t even see the silhouette of the
man inside?”</p>

<p>“No, I saw nothing. His arm was raised.”</p>

<p>“What size was the diamond, do you
think?”</p>

<p>She pursed her lips dubiously.</p>

<p>“He passed me in a flash, and I can’t give
you any very accurate information, Mr. Brixan.
It may be a mistake on my part, but I thought
it was as big as the tip of my finger.
Naturally I couldn’t see any details, even
though I saw the car again last night.”</p>

<p>She went on to tell him of what happened
on the previous night, and he listened
intently.</p>

<p>“The man spoke to you—did you recognize
his voice?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“No—he spoke in a whisper. I did not
see his face, though I have an idea that he
was wearing a cap. The policeman said he
should have taken the number of the car.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the policeman said that, did he?”
remarked Michael sardonically. “Well,
there’s hope for him.”</p>

<p>For a minute he was immersed in thought,
and then:</p>

<p>“I’ll take you to the studio if you don’t
mind,” said Michael.</p>

<p>He left her to go to her dressing-room,
there to learn that work had been suspended
for the day, and went in search of Jack.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen everybody of consequence in
this neighbourhood,” he said. “Do you know
anybody who drives a sedan and wears a
diamond ring on the little finger of the right
hand?”</p>

<p>“The only person I know who has that
weakness is Mendoza,” he said.</p>

<p>Michael whistled.</p>

<p>“I never thought of Mendoza,” he said,
“and Adele described the hand as ‘small and
womanly.’ ”</p>

<p>“Mendoza’s hand isn’t particularly small,
but it would look small on a man,” said Jack
thoughtfully. “And her car isn’t a closed
sedan, but that doesn’t mean anything. By
the way, I’ve just sent instructions to tell the
company I’m working to-day. If we let these
people stand around thinking, they’ll get
thoroughly upset.”</p>

<p>“I thought that too,” said Michael with a
smile, “but I didn’t dare make the suggestion.”</p>

<p>An urgent message took him to London that
afternoon, where he attended a conference of
the Big Five at Scotland Yard. And at the
end of the two-hour discussion, the conclusion
was reached that Sir Gregory Penne was to
remain at large but under observation.</p>

<p>“We verified the story about the lifting of
this girl in Borneo,” said the quiet-spoken
Chief. “And all the facts dovetail. I
haven’t the slightest doubt in my mind that
Penne is the culprit, but we’ve got to walk
very warily. I dare say in your department,
Captain Brixan, you can afford to take a few
risks, but the police in this country never make
an arrest for murder unless they are absolutely
certain that a conviction will follow. There
may be something in your other theory, and
I’d be the last man in the world to turn it
down, but you’ll have to conduct parallel
investigations.”</p>

<p>Michael ran down to Sussex in broad
daylight. There was a long stretch of road
about four miles north of Chichester, and he
was pelting along this when he became aware
of a figure standing in the middle of the
roadway with its arms outstretched, and slowed
down. It was Mr. Sampson Longvale, he saw
to his amazement. Almost before the car had
stopped, with an extraordinary display of
agility Mr. Longvale jumped on the running-board.</p>

<p>“I have been watching for you this last two
hours, Mr. Brixan,” he said. “Do you mind
if I join you?”</p>

<p>“Come right in,” said Michael heartily.</p>

<p>“You are going to Chichester, I know.
Would you mind instead coming to the Dower
House? I have something important to tell
you.”</p>

<p>The place at which he had signalled the car
to stop was exactly opposite the end of the
road that led to the Dower House and Sir
Gregory’s domain. The old man told him
that he had walked back from Chichester,
and had been waiting for the passing of
the car.</p>

<p>“I learnt for the first time, Mr. Brixan, that
you are an officer of the law,” he said, with a
stately inclination of his head. “I need
hardly tell you how greatly I respect one
whose duty it is to serve the cause of justice.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Knebworth told you, I presume?”
said Michael with a smile.</p>

<p>“He told me,” agreed the other gravely.
“I went in really to seek you, having an
intuition that you had some more important
position in life than what I had first imagined.
I confess I thought at first that you were one
of those idle young men who have nothing to
do but to amuse themselves. It was a great
gratification to me to learn that I was mistaken.
It is all the more gratifying”—(Michael
smiled inwardly at the verbosity of age)—“because
I need advice on a point of law,
which I imagine my lawyer would not offer to
me. My position is a very peculiar one, in
some ways embarrassing. I am a man who
shrinks from the eye of the public and am
averse from vulgar intermeddling in other
people’s affairs.”</p>

<p>What had he to tell, Michael wondered—this
old man, with his habit of nocturnal strolls,
might have been a witness to something that
had not yet come out.</p>

<p>They stopped at the Dower House, and the
old man got out and opened the gate, not
closing it until Michael had passed through.
Instead of going direct to his sitting-room, he
went upstairs, beckoning Michael to come
after, and stopped before the room which had
been occupied by Adele on the night of her
terrible experience.</p>

<p>“I wish you to see these people,” said
Mr. Longvale earnestly, “and tell me whether
I am acting in accordance with the law.”</p>

<p>He opened the door, and Mike saw that
there were now two beds in the room. On one,
heavily bandaged and apparently unconscious,
was the brown-faced man; on the other,
sleeping, was the woman Michael had seen in
the tower! She, too, was badly wounded:
her arm was bandaged and strapped into
position.</p>

<p>Michael drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“That is a mystery solved, anyway,” he
said. “Where did you find these people?”</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the woman opened
her eyes and frowned at him fearfully, then
looked across to the man.</p>

<p>“You have been wounded?” said Michael
in Dutch, but apparently her education had
been neglected in respect of European
languages, for she made no reply.</p>

<p>She was so uncomfortable at the sight of him
that Michael was glad to go out of the room.
It was not until they were back in his sanctum
that Mr. Longvale told his story.</p>

<p>“I saw them last night about half-past
eleven,” he said. “They were staggering
down the road, and I thought at first that they
were intoxicated, but fortunately the woman
spoke, and as I have never forgotten a voice,
even when it spoke in a language that was
unfamiliar to me, I realized immediately that
it was my patient, and went out to intercept
her. I then saw the condition of her
companion, and she, recognizing me, began to
speak excitedly in a language which I could
not understand, though I would have been
singularly dense if I had had any doubt as to
her meaning. The man was on the point of
collapse, but, assisted by the woman, I
managed to get him into the house and to the
room where he now is. Fortunately, in the
expectation of again being called to attend
her, I had purchased a small stock of
surgical dressing and was able to attend to the
man.”</p>

<p>“Is he badly hurt?” asked Michael.</p>

<p>“He has lost a considerable quantity of
blood,” said the other, “and, though there
seems to be no arteries severed or bones
broken, the wounds have an alarming appearance.
Now, it has occurred to me,” he went
on, in his oddly profound manner, “that this
unfortunate native could not have received his
injury except as the result of some illegal act,
and I thought the best thing to do was to
notify the police that they were under my care.
I called first upon my excellent friend, Mr.
John Knebworth, and opened my heart to him.
He then told me your position, and I decided
to wait your return before I took any further
steps.”</p>

<p>“You have solved a mystery that has
puzzled me, and incidentally, you have
confirmed a story which I had received with
considerable scepticism,” said Mike. “I think
you were well advised in informing the police—I
will make a report to headquarters, and
send an ambulance to take these two people
to hospital. Is the man fit to be moved?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” nodded the old gentleman.
“He is sleeping heavily now, and has the
appearance of being in a state of coma, but
that is not the case. They are quite welcome
to stay here, though I have no convenience,
and must do my own nursing, which is rather
a bother, for I am not fitted for such a strain.
Happily, the woman is able to do a great deal
for him.”</p>

<p>“Did he have a sword when he arrived?”</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale clicked his lips impatiently.</p>

<p>“How stupid of me to forget that! Yes,
it is in here.”</p>

<p>He went to a drawer in an old-fashioned
bureau, pulled it open and took out the
identical sword which Michael had seen
hanging above the mantelpiece at Griff
Towers. It was spotlessly clean, and had been
so when Mr. Longvale took it from the brown
man’s hands. And yet he did not expect it
to be in any other condition, for to the
swordsman of the East his sword is his child,
and probably the brown man’s first care had
been to wipe it clean.</p>

<p>Michael was taking his leave when he
suddenly asked:</p>

<p>“I wonder if it would give you too much
trouble, Mr. Longvale, to get me a glass of
water? My throat is parched.”</p>

<p>With an exclamation of apology, the old
man hurried away, leaving Michael in the
hall.</p>

<p>Hanging on pegs was the long overcoat of
the master of Dower House, and beside it the
curly-rimmed beaver and a very prosaic
derby hat, which Michael took down the
moment the old man’s back was turned. It
had been no ruse of his, this demand for a
drink, for he was parched. Only Michael
had the inquisitiveness of his profession.</p>

<p>The old gentleman returned quickly to find
Michael examining the hat.</p>

<p>“Where did this come from?” asked the
detective.</p>

<p>“That was the hat the native was wearing
when he arrived,” said Mr. Longvale.</p>

<p>“I will take it with me, if you don’t mind,”
said Michael after a long silence.</p>

<p>“With all the pleasure in life. Our friend
upstairs will not need a hat for a very long
time,” he said, with a whimsical little smile.</p>

<p>Michael went back to his car, put the
hat carefully beside him, and drove into
Chichester; and all the way he was in a state
of wonder. For inside the hat were the
initials “L. F.” How came the hat of Lawley
Foss on the head of the brown man from
Borneo?</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch27'>CHAPTER XXVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE CAVES</span></h1></div>

<p>Mr. Longvale’s two patients were removed to
hospital that night, and, with a favourable
report on the man’s condition from the doctors,
Michael felt that one aspect of the mystery was
a mystery no longer.</p>

<p>His old schoolmaster received a visit that
night.</p>

<p>“More study?” he asked good-humouredly
when Michael was announced.</p>

<p>“Curiously enough, you’re right, sir,” said
Michael, “though I doubt very much whether
you can assist me. I’m looking for an old
history of Chichester.”</p>

<p>“I have one published in 1600. You’re the
second man in the last fortnight who wanted
to see it.”</p>

<p>“Who was the other?” asked Michael
quickly.</p>

<p>“A man named Foss——” began Mr. Scott,
and Michael nodded as though he had known
the identity of the seeker after knowledge.
“He wanted to know about caves. I’ve never
heard there were any local caves of any
celebrity. Now, if this were Cheddar, I should
be able to give you quite a lot of information.
I am an authority on the Cheddar caves.”</p>

<p>He showed Michael into the library, and
taking down an ancient volume, laid it on the
library table.</p>

<p>“After Foss had gone I looked up the reference.
I find it occurs only on one page—385.
It deals with the disappearance of a troop of
horsemen under Sir John Dudley, Earl of Newport,
in some local trouble in the days of
Stephen. Here is the passage.” He pointed.</p>

<p>Michael read, in the old-fashioned type:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The noble Earl, deciding to await hi∫
arrival, carried two <i>companie∫</i> of hor∫e by night
into the great caves which exi∫ted in the∫e
times. By the merciful di∫pen∫ation of God,
in Who∫e Hands we are, there occurred, at
eight o’clock in the forenoon, a great land∫lide
which entombed and de∫troyed all the∫e knights
and ∫quires, and ∫ir John Dudley, Earl of
Newport, ∫o that they were never more ∫een.
And the place of this happening is nine miles
in a line from this ∫ame city, called by the
Romans Regnum, or Ciffancea∫ter in the Saxon
fa∫hion.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“Have the caves ever been located?”</p>

<p>Mr. Scott shook his head.</p>

<p>“There are local rumours that they were
used a century and a half ago by brandy
smugglers, but then you find those traditions
local to every district.”</p>

<p>Michael took a local map of Chichester from
his pocket, measured off nine miles, and with
a pair of compasses encircled the city. He
noted that the line passed either through or
near Sir Gregory’s estate.</p>

<p>“There are two Griff Towers?” he suddenly
said, examining the map.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is another besides Penne’s
place, which is named after a famous local
landmark—the real Griffin Tower (as it was
originally called). I have an idea it stands
either within or about Penne’s property—a very
old, circular tower, about twenty feet high, and
anything up to two thousand years old. I’m
interested in antiquities, and I have made a
very careful inspection of the place. The
lower part of the wall is undoubtedly Roman
work—the Romans had a big encampment
here; in fact, Regnum was one of their headquarters.
There are all sorts of explanations
for the tower. Probably it was a keep or
blockhouse. The idea I have is that the
original Roman tower was not more than a few
feet high and was not designed for defence at
all. Successive ages added to its height, without
exactly knowing why.”</p>

<p>Michael chuckled.</p>

<p>“Now if my theory is correct, I shall hear
more about this Roman castle before the night
is out,” he said.</p>

<p>He gathered his trunks from the hotel and
took them off to his new home. He found that
the dinner-table was laid for three.</p>

<p>“Expecting company?” asked Michael,
watching Jack Knebworth putting the finishing
touches on the table—he had a bachelor’s
finicking sense of neatness, which consists of
placing everything at equal distance from everything
else.</p>

<p>“Yuh! Friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“Of mine?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“I’ve asked young Leamington to come up.
And when I see a man of your age turning pink
at the mention of a girl’s name, I feel sorry for
him. She’s coming partly on business, partly
for the pleasure of meeting me in a human
atmosphere. She didn’t do so well to-day as
I wanted, but I guess we were all a little short
of our best.”</p>

<p>She came soon after, and there was something
about her that was very sweet and appealing;
something that went straight to Michael’s
heart and consolidated the position she had
taken there.</p>

<p>“I was thinking as I came along,” she said,
as Jack Knebworth helped her off with her
coat, “how very unreal everything is—I never
dreamt I should be your guest to dinner, Mr.
Knebworth.”</p>

<p>“And I never dreamt you’d be worthy of
such a distinction,” growled Jack. “And in
five years’ time you’ll be saying, ‘Why on earth
did I make such a fuss about being asked to
a skimpy meal by that punk director Knebworth?’ ”</p>

<p>He put his hand on her shoulder and led her
into the room, and then for the first time she
saw Michael, and that young man had a
momentary sense of dismay when he saw her
face drop. It was only for a second, and, as
if reading his thoughts, she explained her
sudden change of mien.</p>

<p>“I thought we were going to talk nothing but
pictures and pictures!” she said.</p>

<p>“So you shall,” said Michael. “I’m the best
listener on earth, and the first person to mention
murder will be thrown out of the window.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll prepare for the flight!” she said
good-humouredly. “For I’m going to talk
murder and mystery—later!”</p>

<p>Under the expanding influence of a sympathetic
environment the girl took on a new
aspect, and all that Michael had suspected in
her was amply proven. The shyness, the
almost frigid reserve, melted in the company
of two men, one of whom she guessed was fond
of her, while the other—well, Michael was at
least a friend.</p>

<p>“I have been doing detective work this afternoon,”
she said, after the coffee had been
served, “and I’ve made amazing discoveries,”
she added solemnly. “It started by my trying
to track the motor-car, which I guessed must
have come into my street through a lane which
runs across the far end. It is the only motor-car
track I’ve found, and I don’t think there
is any doubt it was my white-handed man who
drove it. You see, I noticed the back tyre,
which had a sort of diamond-shaped design on
it, and it was fairly easy to follow the marks.
Half-way up the lane I found a place where
there was oil in the middle of the road, and
where the car must have stood for some time,
and there—I found this!”</p>

<p>She opened her little handbag and took out
a small, dark-green bottle. It bore no label
and was unstoppered. Michael took it from
her hand, examined it curiously and smelt.
There was a distinctive odour, pungent and
not unpleasing.</p>

<p>“Do you recognize it?” she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Let me try.” Jack Knebworth took the
bottle from Michael’s hand and sniffed. “Butyl
chloride,” he said quickly, and the girl nodded.</p>

<p>“I thought it was that. Father was a
pharmaceutical chemist, and once, when I was
playing in his dispensary, I found a cupboard
open and took down a pretty bottle and opened
it. I don’t know what would have happened
to me, only daddy saw me. I was quite a
child at the time, and I’ve always remembered
that scent.”</p>

<p>“Butyl chloride?” Michael frowned.</p>

<p>“It’s known as the ‘death drop’ or the
‘knock-out drop,’ ” said Knebworth, “and it’s
a drug very much in favour with sharks who
make a business of robbing sailors. A few
drops of that in a glass of wine and you’re out!”</p>

<p>Michael took the bottle again. It was a
commonplace bottle such as is used for the dispensation
of poisons, and in fact the word
“Poison” was blown into the glass.</p>

<p>“There is no trace of a label,” he said.</p>

<p>“And really there is no connection with the
mysterious car,” admitted the girl. “My
surmise is merely guesswork—putting one
sinister thing to another.”</p>

<p>“Where was it?”</p>

<p>“In a ditch, which is very deep there and is
flooded just now, but the bottle didn’t roll down
so far as the water. That is discovery number
one. Here is number two.”</p>

<p>From her bag she took a curious-shaped
piece of steel, both ends of which had the marks
of a break.</p>

<p>“Do you know what that is?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It beats me,” said Jack, and handed the
find to Michael.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> know what it is, because I’ve seen it at
the studio,” said the girl, “and you know too,
don’t you, Mr. Brixan?”</p>

<p>Mike nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s the central link of a handcuff,” he said,
“the link that has the swivel.”</p>

<p>It was covered with spots of rust, which had
been cleaned off—by the girl, as she told him.</p>

<p>“Those are my two finds. I am not going
to offer you my conclusions, because I have
none!”</p>

<p>“They may not have been thrown from the
car at all,” said Michael, “but, as you say,
there is a possibility that the owner of the car
chose that peculiarly deserted spot to rid himself
of two articles which he could not afford to
have on the premises. It would have been
safer to throw them into the sea, but this, I
suppose, was the easier, and, to him, the safer
method. I will keep these.”</p>

<p>He wrapped them in paper, put them away in
his pocket, and the conversation drifted back
to picture-taking, and, as he had anticipated:</p>

<p>“We’re shooting at Griff Tower to-morrow—the
real tower,” said Jack Knebworth. “It
is one of the landmarks—what is there amusing
in Griff Tower?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Nothing particularly amusing, except that
you have fulfilled a prediction of mine,” said
Michael. “I knew I should hear of that
darned old tower!”</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch28'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE TOWER</span></h1></div>

<p>Michael was a little perturbed in mind. He
took a more serious view of the closed car than
did the girl, and the invitation to the “pretty
lady” to step inside was particularly disturbing.
Since the events of the past few days it
had been necessary to withdraw the detective
who was watching the girl’s house, and he
decided to re-establish the guard, employing a
local officer for the purpose.</p>

<p>After he had driven Adele home, he went
to the police station and made his wishes
known; but it was too late to see the chief
constable, and the subordinate officer in charge
did not wish to take the responsibility of
detaching an officer for the purpose. It was
only when Michael threatened to call the chief
on the telephone that he reluctantly drew on
his reserves and put a uniformed officer to
patrol the street.</p>

<p>Back again at Knebworth’s house, Michael
examined the two articles which the girl had
found. Butyl chloride was a drug and a
particularly violent one. What use would the
Head-Hunter have for that, he wondered.</p>

<p>As for the handcuff, he examined it again.
Terrific force must have been employed to snap
the connecting links. This was a mystery to
him, and he gave it up with a sense of annoyance
at his own incompetence.</p>

<p>Before going to bed he received a ’phone
message from Inspector Lyle, who was watching
Griff Towers. There was nothing new to
report, and apparently life was pursuing its
normal round. The inspector had been invited
into the house by Sir Gregory, who had told
him that Bhag was still missing.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep you there to-night,” said Michael.
“To-morrow we will lift the watch. Scotland
Yard is satisfied that Sir Gregory had nothing
to do with Foss’s death.”</p>

<p>A grunt from the other end of the ’phone
expressed the inspector’s disagreement with
that view.</p>

<p>“He’s in it somehow,” he said. “By the
way, I’ve found a bloodstained derby hat in
the field outside the grounds. It has the name
of Chi Li Stores, Tjandi, inside.”</p>

<p>This was news indeed.</p>

<p>“Let me see it in the morning,” said
Michael after long cogitation.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast the next morning the
hat came and was inspected. Knebworth, who
had heard most of the story from Michael,
examined the new clue curiously.</p>

<p>“If the coon wore Lawley’s hat when he
arrived at Mr. Longvale’s, where, in the name
of fate, did the change take place? It must
have been somewhere between the Towers and
the old man’s house, unless——”</p>

<p>“Unless what?” asked Michael. He had a
great respect for Knebworth’s shrewd judgment.</p>

<p>“Unless the change took place at Sir
Gregory’s house. You see that, although it is
bloodstained, there are no cuts in it. Which
is rum.”</p>

<p>“Very rum,” agreed Mike ruefully. “And
yet, if my first theory was correct, the explanation
is simple.”</p>

<p>He did not tell his host what his theory was.</p>

<p>Accompanying Knebworth to the studio, he
watched the char-à-banc drive off, wishing that
he had some excuse and the leisure to accompany
them on their expedition. It was a carefree,
cheery throng, and its very association
was a tonic to his spirits.</p>

<p>He put through his usual call to London.
There was no news. There was really no
reason why he should not go, he decided
recklessly; and as soon as his decision was
taken his car was pounding on the trail of the
joy wagon.</p>

<p>He saw the tower a quarter of an hour before
he came up to it: a squat, ancient building, for
all the world like an inordinately high sheepfold.
When he came up to them the char-à-banc
had been drawn on to the grass, and the
company was putting the finishing touches to
its make-up. Adele he did not see at once—she
was changing in a little canvas tent, whilst
Jack Knebworth and the camera man wrangled
over light and position.</p>

<p>Michael had too much intelligence to butt
in at this moment, and strolled up to the tower,
examining the curious courses which generation
after generation had added to the original
foundations. He knew very little of masonry,
but he was able to detect the Roman portion of
the wall, and thought he saw the place where
Saxon builders had filled in a gap.</p>

<p>One of the hands was fixing a ladder up
which Roselle was to pass. The story which
was being filmed was that of a girl who, starting
life in the chorus, had become the wife of a
nobleman with archaic ideas. The poor but
honest young man who had loved her in her
youth (Michael gathered that a disconsolate
Reggie Connolly played this part) was ever at
hand to help her; and now, when shut up in a
stone room of the keep, it was he who was to
rescue her.</p>

<p>The actual castle tower had been shot in
Arundel. Old Griff Tower was to serve for a
close-up, showing the girl descending from her
prison in the arms of her lover, by the aid of
a rope of knotted sheets.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be deuced awkward getting
down,” said Reggie lugubriously. “Of course,
they’ve got a rope inside the sheet, so there’s
no chance of it breaking. But Miss Leamington
is really fearfully awfully heavy! You try
and lift her yourself, old thing, and see how
you like it!”</p>

<p>Nothing would have given Michael greater
pleasure than to carry out the instructions
literally.</p>

<p>“It’s too robust a part for me, it is really,”
bleated Reggie. “I’m not a cave man, I’m
not indeed! I’ve told Knebworth that it isn’t
the job for me. And besides, why do they
want a close-up? Why don’t they make a
dummy that I could carry and sling about?
And why doesn’t she come down by herself?”</p>

<p>“It’s dead easy,” said Knebworth, who had
walked up and overheard the latter part of the
conversation. “Miss Leamington will hold
the rope and take the weight off you. All
you’ve got to do is to look brave and pretty.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” grumbled Reggie,
“but climbing down ropes is not the job I was
engaged for. We all have our likes and our
dislikes, and that’s one of my dislikes.”</p>

<p>“Try it,” said Jack laconically.</p>

<p>The property man had fixed the rope to an
iron staple which he had driven to the inside
of the tower, the top of which would not be
shown in the picture. The actual descent had
been acted by “doubles” in Arundel on a
long shot: it was only the close-up that Jack
needed. The first rehearsal nearly ended in
disaster. With a squeak, Connolly let go his
burden, and the girl would have fallen but for
her firm grip on the rope.</p>

<p>“Try it again,” stormed Jack. “Remember
you’re playing a man’s part. Young Coogan
would hold her better than that!”</p>

<p>They tried again, with greater success, and
after the third rehearsal, when poor Reggie
was in a state of exhaustion—</p>

<p>“Camera!” said Knebworth shortly, and
then began the actual taking of the picture.</p>

<p>Whatever his other drawbacks were, and
whatever his disadvantages, there was no doubt
that Connolly was an artist. Racked with
agony at this unusual exertion though he was,
he could smile sweetly into the upturned face
of the girl, whilst the camera, fixed upon a
collapsible platform, clicked encouragingly as
it was lowered to keep pace with the escaping
lovers. They touched ground, and with one
last languishing look at the girl, Connolly posed
for the final three seconds.</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” said Jack.</p>

<p>Reggie sat down heavily.</p>

<p>“My heavens!” he wailed, feeling his arms
painfully. “I’ll never do that again, I won’t
really. I’ve had as much of that stuff as ever
I’m going to have, Mr. Knebworth. It was
terrible! I thought I should die!”</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t,” said Jack good-humouredly.
“Now have a rest, you boys and
girls, and then we’ll shoot the escape.”</p>

<p>The camera was moved off twenty or thirty
yards, and whilst Reggie Connolly writhed in
agony on the ground, the girl walked over to
Michael.</p>

<p>“I’m glad that’s over,” she said thankfully.
“Poor Mr. Connolly! The awful language he
was using inside nearly made me laugh, and
that would have meant that we should have
had to take it all over again. But it wasn’t
easy,” she added.</p>

<p>Her own arm was bruised, and the rope had
rubbed raw a little place on her wrist. Michael
had an insane desire to kiss the raw skin, but
restrained himself.</p>

<p>“What did you think of me? Did I look
anything approaching graceful? I felt like a
bundle of straw!”</p>

<p>“You looked—wonderful!” he said fervently,
and she shot a quick glance at him and dropped
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re prejudiced,” she said
demurely.</p>

<p>“I have that feeling too,” said Michael.
“What is inside?” He pointed.</p>

<p>“Inside the tower? Nothing, except a lot
of rock and wild bush, and a pathetic dwarf
tree. I loved it.”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“Just now you said you were glad it was
over. I presume you were referring to the play
and not to the interior of the tower?”</p>

<p>She nodded, a twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>“Mr. Knebworth says he may have to take
a night shot if he’s not satisfied with the day
picture. Poor Mr. Connolly! He’ll throw up
his part.”</p>

<p>At that moment Jack Knebworth’s voice was
heard.</p>

<p>“Don’t take the ladder, Collins,” he shouted.
“Put it down on the grass behind the tower.
I may have to come up here to-night, so you
can leave anything that won’t be hurt by the
weather, and collect it again in the morning.”</p>

<p>Adele made a little face.</p>

<p>“I was afraid he would,” she said. “Not
that I mind very much—it’s rather fun. But
Mr. Connolly’s nervousness communicates itself
in some way. I wish you were playing
that part.”</p>

<p>“I wish to heaven I were!” said Michael,
with such sincerity in his voice that she
coloured.</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth came toward them.</p>

<p>“Did you leave anything up there, Adele?”
he asked, pointing to the tower.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Knebworth,” she said in surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s that?”</p>

<p>He pointed to something round that showed
above the edge of the tower top.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s moving!” he gasped.</p>

<p>As he spoke a head came slowly into view.
It was followed by a massive pair of hairy
shoulders, and then a leg was thrown over the
wall.</p>

<p>It was Bhag!</p>

<p>His tawny hair was white with dust, his face
was powdered grotesquely. All these things
Michael noticed. Then, as the creature put
out his hand to steady himself, Michael saw
that each wrist was encircled by the half of a
broken pair of handcuffs!</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch29'>CHAPTER XXIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BHAG’S RETURN</span></h1></div>

<p>The girl screamed and gripped Michael’s arm.</p>

<p>“What is that?” she asked. “Is it the
Thing that came to my—my room?”</p>

<p>Michael put her aside gently, and ran toward
the tower. As he did so, Bhag took a leap
and dropped on the ground. For a moment he
stood, his knuckles on the ground, his malignant
face turned in the direction of the man. And
then he sniffed, and, with that queer twittering
noise of his, went ambling across the downs
and disappeared over a nearby crest.</p>

<p>Michael raced in pursuit. By the time he
came into view, the great ape was a quarter of
a mile away, running at top speed, and always
keeping close to the hedges that divided the
fields he had to cross. Pursuit was useless,
and the detective went slowly back to the
alarmed company.</p>

<p>“It is only an orang-outang belonging to Sir
Gregory, and perfectly harmless,” he said.
“He has been missing from the house for two
or three days.”</p>

<p>“He must have been hiding in the tower,”
said Knebworth, and Michael nodded. “Well,
I’m darned glad he didn’t choose to come out
at the moment I was shooting,” said the
director, mopping his forehead. “You didn’t
see anything of him, Adele?”</p>

<p>Michael guessed that the girl was pale under
her yellow make-up, and the hand she raised
to her lips shook a little.</p>

<p>“That explains the mystery of the handcuffs,”
said Knebworth.</p>

<p>“Did you notice them?” asked Michael
quickly. “Yes, that explains the broken link,”
he said, “but it doesn’t exactly explain the
butyl chloride.”</p>

<p>He held the girl’s arm as he spoke, and in
the warm, strong pressure she felt something
more than his sympathy.</p>

<p>“Were you a little frightened?”</p>

<p>“I was badly frightened,” she confessed.
“How terrible! Was that Bhag?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“That was Bhag,” he said. “I suppose
he’s been hiding in the tower ever since his
disappearance. You saw nothing when you
were on the top of the wall?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to say I didn’t, or I should have
dropped. There are a large number of bushes
where he might have been hidden.”</p>

<p>Michael decided to look for himself. They
put up the ladder and he climbed to the broad
top of the tower and looked down. At the base
of the stonework the ground sloped away in a
manner curiously reminiscent of the shell-holes
he had seen during the war in France. The
actual floor of the tower was not visible under
the hawthorn bushes which grew thickly at the
centre. He caught a glimpse of the jagged
edges of rock, the distorted branches of an old
tree, and that was all.</p>

<p>There was ample opportunity for concealment.
Possibly Bhag had hidden there most
of the time, sleeping off the effects of his labour
and his wounds; for Michael had seen something
that nobody else had noticed—the gashed
skin, and the ear that had been slashed in half.</p>

<p>He came down the ladder again and rejoined
Knebworth.</p>

<p>“I think that finishes our work for to-day,”
said Jack dubiously. “I smell hysteria, and it
will be a long time before I can get the girls
to come up for a night picture.”</p>

<p>Michael drove the director back in his car,
and all the way home he was considering this
strange appearance of the ape. Somebody had
handcuffed Bhag: he ought to have guessed
that when he saw the torn link. No human
being could have broken those apart. And
Bhag had escaped—from whom? How?
And why had he not returned to Griff Towers
and to his master?</p>

<p>When he had dropped the director at the
studio he went straight on to Gregory’s house,
and found the baronet playing clock-golf on a
strip of lawn that ran by the side of the house.
The man was still heavily bandaged, but he
was making good recovery.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bhag is back. He returned half an
hour ago. Where he has been, heaven knows!
I’ve often wished that chap could talk, but I’ve
never wished it so much as I do at this moment.
Somebody had put irons on him: I’ve just taken
them off.”</p>

<p>“Can I see them?”</p>

<p>“You knew it, did you?”</p>

<p>“I saw him. He came out of the old tower
on the hill.” Michael pointed; from where
they stood, the tower was in sight.</p>

<p>“Is that so? And what the devil was he
doing there?”</p>

<p>Sir Gregory scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“He’s been away before, but mostly he goes
to a shoot of mine about three miles away,
where there’s plenty of cover and no intruders.
I discovered that when a poacher saw him, and,
like a fool, shot at him—that poacher was a
lucky man to escape with his life. Have you
found the body of Foss?”</p>

<p>The baronet had resumed his playing, and
was looking at the ball at his feet.</p>

<p>“No,” said Michael quietly.</p>

<p>“Expect to find it?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised.”</p>

<p>Sir Gregory stood, his hands leaning on his
club, looking across the wold.</p>

<p>“What’s the law in this country, suppose a
man accidentally kills a servant who tried to
knife him?”</p>

<p>“He would have to stand his trial,” said
Michael, “and a verdict of ‘justifiable
homicide’ would be returned and he would be
set free.”</p>

<p>“But suppose he didn’t reveal it? Suppose
he—well, did away with the body—buried it—and
let the matter slide?”</p>

<p>“Then he would place himself in a remarkably
dangerous position,” said Michael.
“Particularly”—he watched the man closely—“if
a woman friend, who is no longer a woman
friend, happened to be a witness or had knowledge
of the act.”</p>

<p>Gregory Penne’s one visible eye blinked
quickly, and he went that curious purple colour
which Michael had seen before when he was
agitated.</p>

<p>“Suppose she tried to get money out of him
by threatening to tell the police?”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the patient Michael, “she
would go to prison for blackmail, and possibly
as an accessory to or after the fact.”</p>

<p>“Would she?” Sir Gregory’s voice was
eager. “She would be an accessory if she saw—him
cut the man down? Mind you, this
happened years ago. There’s a Statute of
Limitations, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Not for murder,” said Michael.</p>

<p>“Murder! Would you call that murder?”
asked the other in alarm. “In self-defence?
Rot!”</p>

<p>Things were gradually being made light to
Michael. Once Stella Mendoza had called the
man a murderer, and Michael’s nimble mind,
which could reconstruct the scene with almost
unerring precision, began to grow active. A
servant, a coloured man, probably, one of his
Malayan slaves, had run amok, and Penne had
killed him—possibly in self-defence—and then
had grown frightened of the consequences. He
remembered Stella’s description—“Penne is a
bluffer and a coward at heart.” That was the
story in a nutshell.</p>

<p>“Where did you bury your unfortunate
victim?” he asked coolly, and the man started.</p>

<p>“Bury? What do you mean?” he blustered.
“I didn’t murder or bury anybody. I was
merely putting a hypothetical case to you.”</p>

<p>“It sounded more real than hypothesis,” said
Michael, “but I won’t press the question.”</p>

<p>In truth, crimes of this character bored
Michael Brixan; and, but for the unusual and
curious circumstances of the Head-Hunter’s
villainies, he would have dropped the case
almost as soon as he came on to it.</p>

<p>There was yet another attraction, which he
did not name, even to himself. As for Sir
Gregory Penne, the grossness of the man and
his hobbies, the sordid vulgarity of his amours,
were more than a little sickening. He would
gladly have cut Sir Gregory out of life, only—he
was not yet sure.</p>

<p>“It is very curious how these questions crop
up,” Penne was saying, as he came out of his
reverie. “A chap like myself, who doesn’t
have much to occupy his mind, gets on an
abstract problem of that kind and never leaves
it. So she’d be an accessory after the fact,
would she? That would mean penal servitude.”</p>

<p>He seemed to derive a great deal of satisfaction
from this thought, and was almost amiable
by the time Michael parted from him, after an
examination of the broken handcuffs. They
were British and of an old pattern.</p>

<p>“Is Bhag hurt very much?” asked Michael
as he put them down.</p>

<p>“Not very much; he’s got a cut or two,”
said the other calmly. He made no attempt to
disguise the happenings of that night. “He
came to my assistance, poor brute! This fellow
nearly got him. In fact, poor old Bhag was
knocked out, but went after them like a brick.”</p>

<p>“What hat was that man wearing—the brown
man?”</p>

<p>“Keji? I don’t know. I suppose he wore
a hat, but I didn’t notice it. Why?”</p>

<p>“I was merely asking,” said Michael carelessly.
“Perhaps he lost it in the caves.”</p>

<p>He watched the other narrowly as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Caves? I’ve never heard about those.
What are they? Are there any caves near
by?” asked Sir Gregory innocently. “You’ve
a wonderful grip of the topography of the
county, Brixan. I’ve been living here off and
on for twenty years, and I lose myself every
time I go into Chichester!”</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch30'>CHAPTER XXX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ADVERTISEMENT</span></h1></div>

<p>The question of the caves intrigued Michael
more than any feature the case had presented.
He bethought himself of Mr. Longvale, whose
knowledge of the country was encyclopædic.
That gentleman was out, but Michael met him,
driving his antique car from Chichester. To
say that he saw him is to mistake facts. The
sound of that old car was audible long before
it came into sight around a bend of the
road. Michael drew up, Longvale following
his example, and parked his car behind that
ancient ’bus.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is rather noisy,” admitted the old
man, rubbing his bald head with a brilliant
bandana handkerchief. “I’m only beginning
to realize the fact of late years. Personally, I
do not think that a noiseless car could give me
as much satisfaction. One feels that something
is happening.”</p>

<p>“You ought to buy a ——” said Michael
with a smile, as he mentioned the name of a
famous car.</p>

<p>“I thought of doing so,” said the other
seriously, “but I love old things—that is my
eccentricity.”</p>

<p>Michael questioned him upon the caves,
and, to his surprise, the old man immediately
returned an affirmative.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard of them frequently. When
I was a boy, my father told me that the country
round was honeycombed with caves, and that,
if anybody was lucky enough to find them,
they would discover great stores of brandy.
Nobody has found them, as far as I know.
There used to be an entrance over there.”
He pointed in the direction of Griff Tower.
“But many years ago——”</p>

<p>He retold the familiar story of the landslide
and of the passing out of two companies
of gallant knights and squires, which
probably the old man had got from the same
source of information as Michael had drawn
upon.</p>

<p>“The popular legend was that a subterranean
river ran into the sea near Selsey Bill—of
course, some distance beneath the surface of
the water. But, as you know, country people
live on such legends. In all probability it is
nothing but a legend.”</p>

<p>Inspector Lyle was waiting for the detective
when he arrived, with news of a startling
character.</p>

<p>“The advertisement appeared in this morning’s
<i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Daily Star</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>Michael took the slip of paper. It was
identically worded with its predecessor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Is your trouble of mind or body incurable?
Do you hesitate on the brink of the abyss?
Does courage fail you?&nbsp;&nbsp;Write to Benefactor,
Box——”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“There will be no reply till to-morrow
morning. Letters are to be readdressed to a
shop in the Lambeth Road, and the chief wants
you to be ready to pick up the trail.”</p>

<p>The trail indeed proved to be well laid. At
four o’clock on the following afternoon, a
lame old woman limped into the newsagent’s
shop on the Lambeth Road and inquired for
a letter addressed to Mr. Vole. There were
three waiting for her. She paid the fee, put
the letters into a rusty old handbag and limped
out of the shop, mumbling and talking to
herself. Passing down the Lambeth Road, she
boarded a tramcar en route for Clapham, and
near the Common she alighted and, passing
out of the region of middle-class houses,
came to a jumble of tenements and ancient
tumble-down dwellings.</p>

<p>Every corner she turned brought her to a
street meaner than the last, and finally to a low,
arched alleyway, the paving of which had not
been renewed for years. It was a little cul-de-sac,
its houses, built in the same pattern, joined
wall to wall, and before the last of these she
stopped, took out a key from her pocket and
opened the door. She was turning to close
it when she was aware that a man stood in the
entrance, a tall, good-looking gentleman, who
must have been on her heels all the time.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, mother,” he said.</p>

<p>The old woman peered at him suspiciously,
grumbling under her breath. Only hospital
doctors and workhouse folk, people connected
with charity, called women “mother”; and
sometimes the police got the habit. Her
grimy old face wrinkled hideously at this last
unpleasant thought.</p>

<p>“I want to have a little talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said shrilly.</p>

<p>The boarding of the passage-way was broken
in half a dozen places and was indescribably
dirty, but it represented the spirit of pure
hygiene compared with the stuffy horror which
was her sitting-room and kitchen.</p>

<p>“What are you, horspital or p’lice?”</p>

<p>“Police,” said Michael. “I want three
letters you’ve collected.”</p>

<p>To his surprise, the woman showed relief.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that all?” she said. “Well, that’s
a job I do for a gentleman. I’ve done it for
years. I’ve never had any complaint before.”</p>

<p>“What is his name?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know his name. Just whatever name
happens to be on the letters. I send ’em on
to him.”</p>

<p>From under a heap of rubbish she produced
three envelopes, addressed in typewritten
characters. The typewriting Michael recognized.
They were addressed to a street in
Guildford.</p>

<p>Michael took the letters from her handbag.
Two of them he read; the third was a dummy
which he himself had written. The most direct
cross-examination, however, revealed nothing.
The woman did the work, receiving a pound for
her trouble, in a letter from the unknown, who
told her where the letters were to be collected.</p>

<p>“She was a little mad and indescribably
beastly,” said Michael in disgust when he
reported, “and the Guildford inquiries don’t
help us forward. There’s another agent there,
who sends the letters back to London, which
they never reach. That is the mystery of
the proceeding. There simply isn’t such an
address at London, and I can only suggest that
they are intercepted en route. The Guildford
police have that matter in hand.”</p>

<p>Staines was very worried.</p>

<p>“Michael, I oughtn’t to have put you on
this job,” he said. “My first thoughts were
best. Scotland Yard is kicking, and say that
the meddling of outsiders is responsible for the
Head-Hunter not being brought to justice.
You know something of inter-departmental
jealousy, and you don’t need me to tell you
that I’m getting more kicks than I’m entitled
to.”</p>

<p>Michael looked down at his chief reflectively.</p>

<p>“I can get the Head-Hunter, but more than
ever I’m convinced that we cannot convict him
until we know a little more about—the caves!”</p>

<p>Staines frowned.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite get you, Mike. Which caves
are these?”</p>

<p>“There are some caves in the neighbourhood
of Chichester. Foss knew about them
and suspected their association with the Head-Hunter.
Give me four days, Major, and I’ll
have them both. And if I fail”—he paused—“if
I fail, the next time you say good morning
to me, I shall be looking up to you from the
interior of one of the Head-Hunter’s boxes!”</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch31'>CHAPTER XXXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>JOHN PERCIVAL LIGGITT</span></h1></div>

<p>It was the second day of Michael’s visit to
town, and, for a reason which she could not
analyse, Adele felt “out” with the world.
And yet the work was going splendidly, and
Jack Knebworth, usually sparing of his praise,
had almost rhapsodized over a little scene
which she had acted with Connolly. So
generous was he in his praise, and so
comprehensive, that even Reggie came in for
his share, and was willing and ready to revise
his earlier estimate of the leading lady’s ability.</p>

<p>“I’ll be perfectly frank and honest, Mr.
Knebworth,” he said, in this moment of
candour, “Leamington is good. Of course,
I’m always on the spot to give her tips, and
there’s nothing quite so educative—if I may
use the term——”</p>

<p>“You may,” said Jack Knebworth.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Connolly. “——as having
a finished artiste playing opposite to you. It
doesn’t do me much good, but it helps her a
lot; it inspires courage and all that sort of
thing. And though I’ve had a perfectly awful,
dreadful time, I feel that she pays for the
coaching.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you?” growled the old man. “And
I’d like to say the same about you, Reggie!
But unfortunately, all the coaching you’ve had
or ever will get is not going to improve you.”</p>

<p>Reggie’s superior smile would have irritated
one less equable than the director.</p>

<p>“You’re perfectly right, Mr. Knebworth,”
he said earnestly. “I can’t improve! I’ve
touched the zenith of my power, and I doubt
whether you’ll ever look upon the like of me
again. I’m certainly the best juvenile lead in
this, and possibly in any country. I’ve had
three offers to go to Hollywood, and you’ll
never believe who is the lady who asked me
to play against her——”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe any of it,” said Jack even-temperedly,
“but you’re right to an extent
about Miss Leamington. She’s fine. And I
agree that it doesn’t do you much good
playing against her, because she makes you
look like a large glass of heavily diluted beer.”</p>

<p>Later in the day, Adele herself asked her
grey-haired chief whether it was true that
Reggie would soon be leaving England for
another and a more ambitious sphere.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think so,” said Jack. “There
never was an actor that hadn’t a better contract
up his sleeve and was ready to take it. But
when it comes to a show-down, you find that
the contracts they’re willing to tear up in order
to take something better, are locked away in
a lawyer’s office and can’t be got out. In the
picture business all over the world, there are
actors and actresses who are leaving by the first
boat to show Hollywood how it’s done. I
guess these liners would sail empty if they
waited for ’em! That’s all bluff, part of the
artificial life of make-believe in which actors
and actresses have their being.”</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Brixan come back?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I’ve not heard from him. There was
a tough-looking fellow called at the studio
half an hour ago to ask whether he’d returned.”</p>

<p>“Rather an unpleasant-looking tramp?” she
asked. “I spoke to him. He said he had a
letter for Mr. Brixan which he would not
deliver to anybody else.”</p>

<p>She looked through the window which
commanded a view of the entrance drive to the
studio. Standing outside on the edge of the
pavement was the wreck of a man. Long,
lank black hair, streaked with grey, fell from
beneath the soiled and dilapidated golf cap;
he was apparently shirtless, for the collar of his
indescribable jacket was buttoned up to his
throat; and his bare toes showed through one
gaping boot.</p>

<p>He might have been a man of sixty, but it
was difficult to arrive at his age. It looked as
though the grey, stubbled beard had not met
a razor since he was in prison last. His eyes
were red and inflamed; his nose that crimson
which is almost blue. His hands were thrust
into the pockets of his trousers, and seemed
to be their only visible means of support, until
you saw the string that was tied around his lean
waist; and as he stood, he shuffled his feet
rhythmically, whistling a doleful tune. From
time to time he took one of his hands from his
pockets and examined the somewhat soiled
envelope it held, and then, as if satisfied with
the scrutiny, put it back again and continued
his jigging vigil.</p>

<p>“Do you think you ought to see that letter?”
asked the girl, troubled. “It may be very
important.”</p>

<p>“I thought that too,” said Jack Knebworth,
“but when I asked him to let me see the
note, he just grinned.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who it’s from?”</p>

<p>“No more than a crow, my dear,” said
Knebworth patiently. “And now let’s get off
the all-absorbing subject of Michael Brixan,
and get back to the fair Roselle. That shot
I took of the tower can’t be bettered, so I’m
going to cut out the night picture, and from
now on we’ll work on the lot.”</p>

<p>The production was a heavy one, unusually
so for one of Knebworth’s; the settings more
elaborate, the crowd bigger than ever he had
handled since he came to England. It was
not an easy day for the girl, and she was
utterly fagged when she started homeward
that night.</p>

<p>“Ain’t seen Mr. Brixan, miss?” said a
high-pitched voice as she reached the side-walk.</p>

<p>She turned with a start. She had forgotten
the existence of the tramp.</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t been,” she said. “You had
better see Mr. Knebworth again. Mr. Brixan
lives with him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it? Ain’t I got all the
information possible about him? I should
say I had!”</p>

<p>“He is in London: I suppose you know
that?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t in London,” said the other
disappointedly. “If he was in London, I
shouldn’t be hanging around here, should I?
No, he left London yesterday. I’m going to
wait till I see him.”</p>

<p>She was amused by his pertinacity, though
it was difficult for her to be amused at anything
in the state of utter weariness into which she
had fallen.</p>

<p>Crossing the market square, she had to
jump quickly to avoid being knocked down by
a car which she knew was Stella Mendoza’s.
Stella could be at times a little reckless, and
the motto upon the golden mascot on her
radiator—“Jump or Die”—held a touch of
sincerity.</p>

<p>She was in a desperate hurry now, and
cursed fluently as she swung her car to avoid
the girl, whom she recognized. Sir Gregory
had come to his senses, and she wanted to get
at him before he lost them again. She pulled
up the car with a jerk at the gates of Griff
Towers, flung open the door and jumped out.</p>

<p>“If I don’t return in two hours, you can
go into Chichester and fetch the police,” she
said.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch32'>CHAPTER XXXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>GREGORY’S WAY</span></h1></div>

<p>Stella had left a note to the same effect on
her table. If she did not return by a certain
hour, the police were to read the letter they
would find on her mantelpiece. She had not
allowed for the fact that neither note nor
letter would be seen until the next morning.</p>

<p>To Stella Mendoza, the interview was one
of the most important and vital in her life.
She had purposely delayed her departure in
the hope that Gregory Penne would take a
more generous view of his obligations, though
she had very little hope that he would change
his mind on the all-important matter of money.
And now, by some miracle, he had relented;
had spoken to her in an almost friendly tone
on the ’phone; had laughed at her reservations
and the precautions which she promised she
would take; and in the end she had overcome
her natural fears.</p>

<p>He received her, not in his library, but in
the big apartment immediately above. It
was longer, for it embraced the space occupied
on the lower floor by the small drawing-room;
but in the matter of furnishing, it differed
materially. Stella had only once been in
“The Splendid Hall,” as he called it. Its
vastness and darkness had frightened her,
and the display which he had organized for
her benefit was one of her unpleasant
memories.</p>

<p>The big room was covered with a thick
black carpet, and the floor space was unrelieved
by any sign of furniture. Divans were set
about, the walls covered with eastern hangings;
there was a row of scarlet pillars up both sides
of the room, and such light as there was
came from three heavily-shaded black lanterns,
which cast pools of yellow light upon the
carpet but did not contribute to the gaiety of
the room.</p>

<p>Penne was sitting cross-legged on a silken
divan, his eyes watching the gyrations of a
native girl as she twirled and twisted to the
queer sound of native guitars played by three
solemn-faced men in the darkened corner of
the room. Gregory wore a suit of flaming red
coloured pyjamas, and his glassy gaze and
brute mouth told Stella all that she wanted to
know about her evil friend.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory Penne was no less and no
more than a slave to his appetites. Born a
rich man, he had never known denial of his
desires. Money had grown to money in a
sort of cellular progression, and when the
normal pleasures of life grew stale, and he was
satiated by the sweets of his possessions, he
found his chiefest satisfaction in taking that
which was forbidden. The raids which his
agents had made from time to time in the
jungles of his second home gave him trophies,
human and material, that lost their value when
they were under his hand.</p>

<p>Stella, who had visions of becoming mistress
of Griff Towers, became less attractive as she
grew more complaisant. And at last her
attraction had vanished, and she was no more
to him than the table at which he sat.</p>

<p>A doctor had told him that drink would
kill him—he drank the more. Liquor brought
him splendid visions, precious stories that
wove themselves into dazzling fabrics of
dreams. It pleased him to place, in the forefront
of his fuddled mind, a slip of a girl who
hated him. A gross bully, an equally gross
coward, he could not or would not argue
a theme to its logical and unpleasant
conclusion. At the end there was always
his money that could be paid in smaller or
larger quantities to settle all grievances
against him.</p>

<p>The native who had conducted Stella
Mendoza to the apartment had disappeared,
and she waited at the end of the divan, looking
at the man for a long time before he took
any notice of her. Presently he turned his
head and favoured her with a stupid, vacant
stare.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Stella,” he said thickly, “sit
down. You couldn’t dance like that, eh?
None of you Europeans have got the grace,
the suppleness. Look at her!”</p>

<p>The dancing girl was twirling at a furious
rate, her scanty draperies enveloping her like
a cloud. Presently, with a crash of the
guitars, she sank, face downward, on the
carpet. Gregory said something in Malayan,
and the woman showed her white teeth in a
smile. Stella had seen her before: there
used to be two dancing girls, but one had
contracted scarlet fever and had been hurriedly
deported. Gregory had a horror of disease.</p>

<p>“Sit down here,” he commanded, laying
his hand on the divan.</p>

<p>As if by magic, every servant in the room
had disappeared, and she suddenly felt cold.</p>

<p>“I’ve left my chauffeur outside, with
instructions to go for the police if I’m not
out in half an hour,” she said loudly, and he
laughed.</p>

<p>“You ought to have brought your nurse,
Stella. What’s the matter with you nowadays?
Can’t you talk anything but police?
I want to talk to you,” he said in a milder tone.</p>

<p>“And I want to talk to you, Gregory. I am
leaving Chichester for good, and I don’t want
to see the place again.”</p>

<p>“That means you don’t want to see me
again, eh? Well, I’m pretty well through with
you, and there’s going to be no weeping and
wailing and gnashing of teeth on my part.”</p>

<p>“My new company——” she began, and he
stopped her with a gesture.</p>

<p>“If your new company depends upon my
putting up the money, you can forget it,” he
said roughly. “I’ve seen my lawyer—at least,
I’ve seen somebody who knows—and he tells
me that if you’re trying to blackmail me about
Tjarji, you’re liable to get into trouble
yourself. I’ll put up money for you,” he
went on. “Not a lot, but enough. I don’t
suppose you’re a beggar, for I’ve given you
sufficient already to start three companies.
Stella, I’m crazy about that girl.”</p>

<p>She looked at him, her mouth open in
surprise.</p>

<p>“What girl?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Adele. Isn’t that her name?—Adele
Leamington.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the extra girl that took my
place?” she gasped.</p>

<p>He nodded, his sleepy eyes fixed on hers.</p>

<p>“That’s it. She’s my type, more than you
ever were, Stella. And that isn’t meant in
any way disparaging to you.”</p>

<p>She was content to listen: his declaration
had taken her breath away.</p>

<p>“I’ll go a long way to get her,” he went on.
“I’d marry her, if that meant anything to her—it’s
about time I married, anyway. Now
you’re a friend of hers——”</p>

<p>“A friend!” scoffed Stella, finding her
voice. “How could I be a friend of hers
when she has taken my place? And what if
I were? You don’t suppose I should bring a
girl to this hell upon earth?”</p>

<p>He brought his eyes around to hers—cold,
malignant, menacing.</p>

<p>“This hell upon earth has been heaven for
you. It has given you wings, anyway! Don’t
go back to London, Stella, not for a week or
two. Get to know this girl. You’ve got
opportunities that nobody else has. Kid her
along—you’re not going to lose anything by
it. Speak about me; tell her what a good
fellow I am; and tell her what a chance she
has. You needn’t mention marriage, but you
can if it helps any. Show her some of your
jewels—that big pendant I gave you——”</p>

<p>He rambled on, and she listened, her
bewilderment giving place to an uncontrollable
fury.</p>

<p>“You brute!” she said at last. “To dare
suggest that I should bring this girl to Griff!
I don’t like her—naturally. But I’d go down
on my knees to her to beg her not to come.
You think I’m jealous?” Her lips curled at
the sight of the smile on his face. “That’s
where you’re wrong, Gregory. I’m jealous of
the position she’s taken at the studio, but, so
far as you’re concerned”—she shrugged her
shoulders—“you mean nothing to me. I
doubt very much if you’ve ever meant more
than a steady source of income. That’s
candid, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>She got up from the divan and began putting
on her gloves.</p>

<p>“As you don’t seem to want to help me,”
she said, “I’ll have to find a way of making
you keep your promise. And you did promise
me a company, Gregory; I suppose you’ve
forgotten that?”</p>

<p>“I was more interested in you then,” he
said. “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I’m going back to my cottage, and
to-morrow I’m returning to town,” she said.</p>

<p>He looked first at one end of the room and
then at the other, and then at her.</p>

<p>“You’re not going back to your cottage;
you’re staying here, my dear,” he said.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“You told your chauffeur to go for the
police, did you? I’ll tell <em>you</em> something!
Your chauffeur is in my kitchen at this moment,
having his supper. If you think that he’s
likely to leave before you, you don’t know me,
Stella!”</p>

<p>He gathered up the dressing-gown that was
spread on the divan and slipped his arms into
the hanging sleeves. A terrible figure he was
in the girl’s eyes, something unclean, obscene.
The scarlet pyjama jacket gave his face a
demoniacal value, and she felt herself cringing
from him.</p>

<p>He was quick to notice the action, and his
eyes glowed with a light of triumph.</p>

<p>“Bhag is downstairs,” he said significantly.
“He handles people rough. He handled one
girl so that I had to call in a doctor. You’ll
come with me without—assistance?”</p>

<p>She nodded dumbly; her knees gave way
under her as she walked. She had bearded
the beast in his den once too often.</p>

<p>Half-way along the corridor he unlocked a
door of a room and pushed it open.</p>

<p>“Go there and stay there,” he said. “I’ll
talk to you to-morrow, when I’m sober. I’m
drunk now. Maybe I’ll send you someone
to keep you company—I don’t know yet.”
He ruffled his scanty hair in drunken
perplexity. “But I’ve got to be sober before
I deal with you.”</p>

<p>The door slammed on her and a key turned.
She was in complete darkness, in a room
she did not know. For one wild, terrified
moment she wondered if she was alone.</p>

<p>It was a long time before her palm touched
the little button projecting from the wall. She
pressed it. A lamp enclosed in a crystal
globe set in the ceiling flashed into sparkling
light. She was in what had evidently been
a small bedroom. The bedstead had been
removed, but a mattress and a pillow were
folded up in one corner. There was a
window, heavily barred, but no other exit.
She examined the door: the handle turned in
her grasp; there was not even a keyhole in
which she could try her own key.</p>

<p>Going to the window, she pulled up the
sash, for the room was stuffy and airless. She
found herself looking out from the back of the
house, across the lawn to a belt of trees which
she could just discern. The road ran parallel
with the front of the house, and the shrillest
scream would not be heard by anybody on
the road.</p>

<p>Sitting down in one of the chairs, she
considered her position. Having overcome
her fear, she had that in her possession which
would overcome Gregory if it came to a fight.
Pulling up her skirt, she unbuckled the soft
leather belt about her waist, and from the
Russian leather holster it supported, she took
a diminutive Browning—a toy of a weapon
but wholly business-like in action. Sliding
back the jacket, she threw a cartridge into the
chamber and pulled up the safety-catch; then
she examined the magazine and pressed it
back again.</p>

<p>“Now, Gregory,” she said aloud, and at
that moment her face went round to the
window, and she started up with a scream.</p>

<p>Two grimy hands gripped the bars; glaring
in at her was the horrible face of a tramp.
Her trembling hand shot out for the pistol,
but before it could close on the butt, the face
had disappeared; and though she went round
to the window and looked out, the bars
prevented her from getting a clear view of
the parapet along which the uncouth figure
was creeping.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch33'>CHAPTER XXXIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE TRAP THAT FAILED</span></h1></div>

<p>Ten o’clock was striking from Chichester
cathedral when the tramp, who half an hour
ago had been peering and prying into the
secrets of Griff Towers, made his appearance
in the market-place. His clothes were even
more dusty and soiled, and a policeman who
saw him stood squarely in his path.</p>

<p>“On the road?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” whined the man.</p>

<p>“You can get out of Chichester as quick as
you like,” said the officer. “Are you looking
for a bed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you try the casual ward at the
workhouse?”</p>

<p>“They’re full up, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie,” said the officer. “Now
understand, if I see you again I’ll arrest you!”</p>

<p>Muttering something to himself, the squalid
figure moved on toward the Arundel Road,
his shoulders hunched, his hands hidden in
the depths of his pockets.</p>

<p>Out of sight of the policeman, he turned
abruptly to the right and accelerated his pace.
He was making for Jack Knebworth’s house.
The director heard the knock, opened the door
and stood aghast at the unexpected character
of the caller.</p>

<p>“What do you want, bo’?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Brixan come back?”</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t come back. You’d better
give me that letter. I’ll get in touch with
him by ’phone.”</p>

<p>The tramp grinned and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t. I want to see Brixan.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t see him here to-night,”
said Jack. And then, suspiciously: “My
idea is that you don’t want to see him at all,
and that you’re hanging around for some
other purpose.”</p>

<p>The tramp did not reply. He was whistling
softly a distorted passage from the “Indian
Love Lyrics,” and all the time his right foot
was beating the time.</p>

<p>“He’s in a bad way, is old Brixan,” he said,
and there was a certain amount of pleasure in
his voice that annoyed Knebworth.</p>

<p>“What do you know about him?”</p>

<p>“I know he’s in bad with headquarters—that’s
what I know,” said the tramp. “He
couldn’t find where the letters went to: that’s
the trouble with him. But <em>I</em> know.”</p>

<p>“Is that what you want to see him about?”</p>

<p>The man nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said again. “I could tell
him something if he was here, but he ain’t
here.”</p>

<p>“If you know he isn’t here,” asked the
exasperated Jack, “why in blazes do you
come?”</p>

<p>“Because the police are chivvying me,
that’s why. A copper down on the market-place
is going to pinch me next time he sees
me. So I thought I’d come up to fill in the
time, that’s what!”</p>

<p>Jack stared at him.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a nerve,” he said in awe-stricken
tones. “And now you’ve filled in
your time and I’ve entertained you, you can
get! Do you want anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Not me,” said the tramp. “I live on the
fat of the land, I do!”</p>

<p>His shrill Cockney voice was getting on
Jack’s nerves.</p>

<p>“Well, good night,” he said shortly, and
closed the door on his unprepossessing visitor.</p>

<p>The tramp waited for quite a long time
before he made any move. Then, from the
interior of his cap, he took a cigarette and lit
it before he shuffled back the way he had come,
making a long detour to avoid the centre of
the town, where the unfriendly policeman was
on duty. A church clock was striking a
quarter past ten when he reached the corner
of the Arundel Road, and, throwing away his
cigarette, moved into the shadow of the fence
and waited.</p>

<p>Five minutes, ten minutes passed, and his
keen eyes caught sight of a man walking
rapidly the way he had come, and he grinned
in the darkness. It was Knebworth. Jack
had been perturbed by the visitor, and was
on his way to the police station to make
inquiries about Michael. This the tramp
guessed, though he had little time to
consider the director’s movements, for a car
came noiselessly around the corner and
stopped immediately opposite him.</p>

<p>“Is that you, my friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the tramp in a sulky voice.</p>

<p>“Come inside.”</p>

<p>The tramp lurched forward, peering into
the dark interior of the car. Then, with a
turn of his wrist, he jerked open the door, put
one foot on the running-board, and suddenly
flung himself upon the driver.</p>

<p>“<em>Mr. Head-Hunter, I want you!</em>” he
hissed.</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth
before something soft and wet struck him in
the face—something that blinded and choked
him, so that he let go his grip and fought
and clawed like a dying man at the air. A
push of the driver’s foot, and he was flung,
breathless, to the side-walk, and the car
sped on.</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth had witnessed the scene
as far as it could be witnessed in the half-darkness,
and came running across. A policeman
appeared from nowhere, and together
they lifted the tramp into a sitting position.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen this fellow before to-night,” said
the policeman. “I warned him.”</p>

<p>And then the prostrate man drew a long,
sighing breath, and his hands went up to his
eyes.</p>

<p>“This is where I hand in my resignation,”
he said, and Knebworth’s jaw dropped.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Michael Brixan!</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch34'>CHAPTER XXXIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SEARCH</span></h1></div>

<p>“Yes, it’s me,” said Michael bitterly. “All
right, officer, you needn’t wait. Jack, I’ll
come up to the house to get this make-up off.”</p>

<p>“For the Lord’s sake!” breathed Knebworth,
staring at the detective. “I’ve never
seen a man made up so well that he deceived
me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve deceived everybody, including myself,”
said Michael savagely. “I thought I’d
caught him with a dummy letter, instead of
which the devil caught me.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“Ammonia, I think—a concentrated solution
thereof,” said Michael.</p>

<p>It was twenty minutes before he emerged
from the bathroom, his eyes inflamed but
otherwise his old self.</p>

<p>“I wanted to trap him in my own way, but
he was too smart for me.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who he is?”</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know,” he said. “I’ve got a
special force of men here, waiting to effect the
arrest, but I didn’t want a fuss, and I certainly
did not want bloodshed. And bloodshed
there will be, unless I am mistaken.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t seem to recognize the car, and I
know most of the machines in this city,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“It is a new one, used only for these
midnight adventures of the Head-Hunter.
He probably garages it away from his house.
You asked me if I’d have something to eat
just now, and I lied and told you I was living
on the fat of the land. Give me some food,
for the love of heaven!”</p>

<p>Jack went into the larder and brought out
some cold meat, brewed a pot of coffee, and
sat in silence, watching the famished detective
dispose of the viands.</p>

<p>“I feel a man now,” said Michael as he
finished, “for I’d had nothing to eat except
a biscuit since eleven this morning. By the
way, our friend Stella Mendoza is staying at
Griff Towers, and I’m afraid I rather scared
her. I happened to be nosing round there an
hour ago, to make absolutely sure of my bird,
and I looked in upon her—to her alarm!”</p>

<p>There came a sharp rap at the door, and
Jack Knebworth looked up.</p>

<p>“Who’s that at this time of night?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Probably the policeman,” said Michael.</p>

<p>Knebworth opened the door and found
a short, stout, middle-aged woman standing on
the doorstep with a roll of paper in her hand.</p>

<p>“Is this Mr. Knebworth’s?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought the play that Miss Leamington
left behind. She asked me to bring it to
you.”</p>

<p>Knebworth took the roll of paper and
slipped off the elastic band which encircled it.
It was the manuscript of “Roselle.”</p>

<p>“Why have you brought this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“She told me to bring it up if I found it.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Jack, mystified. “Thank
you very much.”</p>

<p>He closed the door on the woman and went
back to the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Adele has sent up her script. What’s
wrong, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Who brought it?” asked Michael,
interested.</p>

<p>“Her landlady, I suppose,” said Jack,
describing the woman.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s she. Adele is not turning in
her part?”</p>

<p>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be likely.”</p>

<p>Michael was puzzled.</p>

<p>“What the dickens does it mean? What
did the woman say?”</p>

<p>“She said that Miss Leamington wanted
her to bring up the manuscript if she found it.”</p>

<p>Michael was out of the house in a second,
and, racing down the street, overtook the
woman.</p>

<p>“Will you come back, please?” he said,
and escorted her to the house again. “Just
tell Mr. Knebworth why Miss Leamington
sent this manuscript, and what you mean by
having ‘forgotten’ it.”</p>

<p>“Why, when she came up to you——”
began the woman.</p>

<p>“Came up to me?” cried Knebworth
quickly.</p>

<p>“A gentleman from the studio called for
her, and said you wanted to see her,” said the
landlady. “Miss Leamington was just going
to bed, but I took up the message. He said
you wanted to see her about the play, and
asked her to bring the manuscript. She had
mislaid it somewhere and was in a great state
about it, so I told her to go on, as you were in
a hurry, and I’d bring it up. At least, she
asked me to do that.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a gentleman was it who
called?”</p>

<p>“A rather stout gentleman. He wasn’t
exactly a gentleman, he was a chauffeur. As
a matter of fact, I thought he’d been drinking,
though I didn’t want to alarm Miss
Leamington by telling her so.”</p>

<p>“And then what happened?” asked Michael
quickly.</p>

<p>“She came down and got in the car. The
chauffeur was already in.”</p>

<p>“A closed car, I suppose?”</p>

<p>The woman nodded.</p>

<p>“And then they drove off? What time was
this?”</p>

<p>“Just after half-past ten. I remember,
because I heard the church clock strike just
before the car drove up.”</p>

<p>Michael was cool now. His voice scarcely
rose above a whisper.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five past eleven,” he said, looking
at his watch. “You’ve been a long time
coming.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t find the paper, sir. It was
under Miss Leamington’s pillow. Isn’t she
here?”</p>

<p>“No, she’s not here,” said Michael quietly.
“Thank you very much; I won’t keep you.
Will you wait for me at the police station?”</p>

<p>He went upstairs and put on his coat.</p>

<p>“Where do you think she is?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“She is at Griff Towers,” replied the other,
“and whether Gregory Penne lives or dies this
night depends entirely upon the treatment that
Adele has received at his hands.”</p>

<p>At the police station he found the landlady,
a little frightened, more than a little tearful.</p>

<p>“What was Miss Leamington wearing when
she went out?”</p>

<p>“Her blue cloak, sir,” whimpered the
woman, “that pretty blue cloak she always
wore.”</p>

<p>Scotland Yard men were at the station, and
it was a heavily loaded car that ran out to
Chichester—too heavy for Michael, in a fever
of impatience, for the weight of its human
cargo checked its speed, and every second was
precious. At last, after an eternity of time,
the big car swung into the drive. Michael
did not stop to waken the lodge-keeper, but
smashed the frail gates open with the buffers
of his machine, mounted the slope, crossing
the gravel parade, and halted.</p>

<p>There was no need to ring the bell: the door
was wide open, and, at the head of his party,
Mike Brixan dashed through the deserted hall,
along the corridor into Gregory’s library.
One light burnt, offering a feeble illumination,
but the room was empty. With rapid strides
he crossed to the desk and turned the switch.
Bhag’s den opened, but Bhag too was an
absentee.</p>

<p>He pressed the bell by the side of the
fireplace, and almost immediately the brown-faced
servitor whom he had seen before came
trembling into the room.</p>

<p>“Where is your master?” asked Michael in
Dutch.</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he replied, but instinctively
he looked up to the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Show me the way.”</p>

<p>They went back to the hall, up the broad
stairway on to the first floor. Along a corridor,
hung with swords, as was its fellow below, he
reached another open door—the great dance
hall where Gregory Penne had held revel that
evening. There was nobody in sight, and
Michael came out into the hall. As he did so,
he was aware of a frantic tapping at one of
the doors in the corridor. The key was in the
lock: he turned it and flung the door wide
open, and Stella Mendoza, white as death,
staggered out.</p>

<p>“Where is Adele?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you that,” said Michael
sternly. “Where is she?”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head helplessly, strove
to speak, and then collapsed in a swoon.</p>

<p>He did not wait for her to recover, but
continued his search. From room to room he
went, but there was no sign of Adele or the
brutal owner of Griff Towers. He searched the
library again, and passed through into the little
drawing-room, where a table was laid for two.
The cloth was wet with spilt wine; one glass
was half empty—but the two for whom the
table was laid had vanished. They must have
gone out of the front door—whither?</p>

<p>He was standing tense, his mind concentrated
upon a problem that was more vital
to him than life itself, when he heard a sound
that came from the direction of Bhag’s den.
And then there appeared in the doorway the
monstrous ape himself. He was bleeding
from a wound in the shoulder; the blood fell
drip-drip-drip as he stood, clutching in his two
great hands something that seemed like a
bundle of rags. As Michael looked, the room
rocked before his eyes.</p>

<p>The tattered, stained garment that Bhag
held was the cloak that Adele Leamington had
worn!</p>

<p>For a second Bhag glared at the man who
he knew was his enemy, and then, dropping
the cloak, he shrank back toward his quarters,
his teeth bared.</p>

<p>Three times Michael’s automatic spat, and
the great, man-like thing disappeared in a flash—and
the door closed with a click.</p>

<p>Knebworth had been a witness of the scene.
It was he who ran forward and picked up the
cloak that the ape had dropped.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was hers,” he said huskily, and a
horrible thought chilled him.</p>

<p>Michael had opened the door of the den,
and, pistol in hand, dashed through the
opening. Knebworth dared not follow. He
stood petrified, waiting, and then Michael
reappeared.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing here,” he said.</p>

<p>“Nothing?” asked Jack Knebworth in a
whisper. “Thank God!”</p>

<p>“Bhag has gone—I think I may have hit
him; there is a trail of blood, but I may not
be responsible for that. He had been shot
recently,” he pointed to stains on the floor.
“He wasn’t shot when I saw him last.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen him before to-night?”</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“For three nights he has been haunting
Longvale’s house.”</p>

<p>“Longvale’s!”</p>

<p>Where was Adele? That was the one
dominant question, the one thought uppermost
in Michael Brixan’s mind. And where was the
baronet? What was the meaning of that open
door? None of the servants could tell him,
and for some reason he saw that they were
speaking the truth. Only Penne and the girl—and
this great ape—knew, unless——</p>

<p>He hurried back to where he had left a
detective trying to revive the unconscious
Stella Mendoza.</p>

<p>“She has passed from one fainting fit to
another,” said the officer. “I can get nothing
out of her except that once she said ‘Kill him,
Adele.’ ”</p>

<p>“Then she has seen her!” said Michael.</p>

<p>One of the officers he had left outside to
watch the building had a report to make. He
had seen a dark figure climbing the wall and
disappear apparently through the solid brickwork.
A few minutes later it had come out
again.</p>

<p>“That was Bhag,” said Michael. “I knew
he was not here when we arrived. He must
have come in through the opening while we
were upstairs.”</p>

<p>The car that had carried Adele had been
found. It was Stella’s, and at first Michael
suspected that the girl was a party to the
abduction. He learnt afterwards that, whilst
the woman’s chauffeur had been in the kitchen,
virtually a prisoner, Penne himself had driven
the car to the girl’s house, and it was the
sight of the machine, which she knew belonged
to Stella, that had lulled any suspicions she
may have had.</p>

<p>Michael was in a condition bordering upon
frenzy. The Head-Hunter and his capture
was insignificant compared with the safety of
the girl.</p>

<p>“If I don’t find her I shall go mad,” he
said.</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth had opened his lips to
answer when there came a startling interruption.
Borne on the still night air came a
scream of agony which turned the director’s
blood to ice.</p>

<p>“Help, help!”</p>

<p>Shrill as was the cry, Michael knew that
it was the voice of a man, and knew that that
man was Gregory Penne!</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch35'>CHAPTER XXXV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>WHAT HAPPENED TO ADELE</span></h1></div>

<p>There were moments when Adele Leamington
had doubts as to her fitness for the profession
she had entered; and never were those periods
of doubt more poignant than when she tried
to fix her mind upon the written directions of
the scenario. She blamed Michael, and was
immediately repentant. She blamed herself
more freely; and at last she gave up the
struggle, rolled up the manuscript book, and,
putting an elastic band about it, thrust it under
her pillow and prepared for bed. She had
rid herself of skirt and blouse when the
summons came.</p>

<p>“From Mr. Knebworth?” she said in
surprise. “At this time of night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss. He’s going to make a big
alteration to-morrow and he wants to see you
at once. He has sent his car. Miss Mendoza
is coming into the cast.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said faintly.</p>

<p>Then she had been a failure, after all, and
had lived in a fool’s paradise for these past
days.</p>

<p>“I’ll come at once,” she said.</p>

<p>Her fingers trembled as she fastened her
dress, and she hated herself for such a display
of weakness. Perhaps Stella was not coming
into the cast in her old part; perhaps some new
character had been written in; perhaps it was
not for “Roselle” at all that she had been
re-engaged. These and other speculations
rioted in her mind; and she was in the
passage and the door was opened when she
remembered that Jack Knebworth would want
the manuscript. She ran upstairs, and, by an
aberration of memory, forgot entirely where
the script had been left. At last, in despair,
she went down to the landlady.</p>

<p>“I have left some manuscripts which are
rather important. Would you bring them up
to Mr. Knebworth’s house when you find
them? They’re in a little brown jacket——”
She described the appearance as well as she
could.</p>

<p>It was Stella Mendoza’s car; she recognized
the machine with a pang. So Jack and she
were reconciled!</p>

<p>In a minute she was inside the machine, the
door closed behind her, and was sitting by
the driver, who did not speak.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Brixan with Mr. Knebworth?” she
asked.</p>

<p>He did not reply. She thought he had not
heard her, until he turned with a wide sweep
and set the car going in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“This is not the way to Mr. Knebworth’s,”
she said in alarm. “Don’t you know the
way?”</p>

<p>Still he made no reply. The machine
gathered speed, passed down a long, dark
street, and turned into a country lane.</p>

<p>“Stop the car at once!” she said, terrified,
and put her hand on the handle of the door.</p>

<p>Instantly her arm was gripped.</p>

<p>“My dear, you’re going to injure your
pretty little body, and probably spoil your
beautiful face, if you attempt to get out while
the car is in motion,” he said.</p>

<p>“Sir Gregory!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Now don’t make a fuss,” said Gregory.
There was no mistaking the elation in his
voice. “You’re coming up to have a little bit
of supper with me. I’ve asked you often
enough, and now you’re going willy-nilly!
Stella’s there, so there’s nothing to be afraid
of.”</p>

<p>She held down her fears with an effort.</p>

<p>“Sir Gregory, you will take me back at
once to my lodgings,” she said. “This is
disgraceful of you!”</p>

<p>He chuckled loudly.</p>

<p>“Nothing’s going to happen to you;
nobody’s going to hurt you, and you’ll be
delivered safe and sound; but you’re going to
have supper with me first, little darling. And
if you make a fuss, I’m going to turn the car
into the first tree I see and smash us all up!”</p>

<p>He was drunk—drunk not only with wine,
but with the lust of power. Gregory had
achieved his object, and would stop at nothing
now.</p>

<p>Was Stella there? She did not believe
him. And yet it might be true. She grasped
at the straw which Stella’s presence offered.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” grunted Gregory, as he
stopped the car before the Towers door and
slipped out on to the gravel.</p>

<p>Before she realized what he was doing, he
had lifted her in his arms, though she
struggled desperately.</p>

<p>“If you scream I’ll kiss you,” growled his
voice in her ear, and she lay passive.</p>

<p>The door opened instantly. She looked
down at the servant standing stolidly in the
hall, as Gregory carried her up the wide
stairway, and wondered what help might come
from him. Presently Penne set her down on
her feet and, opening a door, thrust her in.</p>

<p>“Here’s your friend, Stella,” he said.
“Say the good word for me! Knock some
sense into her head if you can. I’ll come
back in ten minutes, and we’ll have the
grandest little wedding supper that any
bridegroom ever had.”</p>

<p>The door was banged and locked upon her
before she realized there was another woman
in the room. It was Stella. Her heart rose
at the sight of the girl’s white face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Mendoza,” she said breathlessly,
“thank God you’re here!”</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch36'>CHAPTER XXXVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ESCAPE</span></h1></div>

<p>“Don’t start thanking God too soon,” said
Stella with ominous calm. “Oh, you little
fool, why did you come here?”</p>

<p>“He brought me. I didn’t want to come,”
said Adele.</p>

<p>She was half hysterical in her fright. She
tried hard to imitate the calm of her
companion, biting her quivering lips to keep
them still, and after a while she was calm
enough to tell what had happened. Stella’s
face clouded.</p>

<p>“Of course, he took my car,” she said,
speaking to herself, “and he has caught the
chauffeur, as he said he would. Oh, my
God!”</p>

<p>“What will he do?” asked Adele in a
whisper.</p>

<p>Stella’s fine eyes turned on the girl.</p>

<p>“What do you think he will do?” she
asked significantly. “He’s a beast—the kind
of beast you seldom meet except in books—and
locked rooms. He’ll have no more mercy
on you than Bhag would have on you.”</p>

<p>“If Michael knows, he will kill him.”</p>

<p>“Michael? Oh, Brixan, you mean?” said
Stella with newly awakened interest. “Is he
fond of you? Is that why he hangs around
the lot? That never struck me before. But
what does he care about Michael or any
other man? He can run—his yacht is at
Southampton, and he depends a lot upon his
wealth to get him out of these kind of scrapes.
And he knows that decent women shrink from
appearance in a police court. Oh, he’s got all
sorts of defences. He’s a worm, but a scaly
worm!”</p>

<p>“What shall I do?”</p>

<p>Stella was walking up and down the narrow
apartment, her hands clasped before her, her
eyes sunk to the ground.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he’ll hurt me.” And then,
inconsequently, she went off at a tangent: “I
saw a tramp at that window two hours ago.”</p>

<p>“A tramp?” said the bewildered girl.</p>

<p>Stella nodded.</p>

<p>“It scared me terribly, until I remembered
his eyes. They were Brixan’s eyes, though
you’d never guess it, the make-up was so
wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Michael? Is he here?” asked the girl
eagerly.</p>

<p>“He’s somewhere around. That is your
salvation, and there’s another.”</p>

<p>She took down from a shelf a small Browning.</p>

<p>“Did you ever fire a pistol?”</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>“I have to, in one scene,” she said a little
awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Of course! Well, this is loaded. That”—she
pointed—“is the safety catch. Push it
down with your thumb before you start to use
it. You had better kill Penne—better for you,
and better for him, I think.”</p>

<p>The girl shrank back in horror.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!”</p>

<p>“Put it in your pocket—have you a pocket?”</p>

<p>There was one inside the blue cloak the girl
was wearing, and into this Stella dropped the
pistol.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what sort of sacrifice I’m
making,” she said frankly, “and it isn’t as
though I’m doing it for somebody I’m fond of,
because I’m not particularly fond of you, Adele
Leamington. But I wouldn’t be fit to live if I
let that brute get you without a struggle.”</p>

<p>And then impulsively she stooped forward
and kissed the girl, and Adele put her arms
about her neck and clung to her for a second.</p>

<p>“He’s coming,” whispered Stella Mendoza,
and stepped back with a gesture.</p>

<p>It was Gregory—Gregory in his scarlet
pyjama jacket and purple dressing-gown, his
face aflame, his eyes fired with excitement.</p>

<p>“Come on, you!” He crooked his finger.
“Not you, Mendoza: you stay here, eh? You
can see her after, perhaps—after supper.”</p>

<p>He leered down at the shrinking girl.</p>

<p>“Nobody’s going to hurt you. Leave your
cloak here.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll wear it,” she said.</p>

<p>Her hand went instinctively to the butt of
the pistol and closed upon it.</p>

<p>“All right, come as you are. It makes no
difference to me.”</p>

<p>He held her tightly by the hand and marched
by her side, surprised and pleased that she
offered so little resistance. Down into the hall
they went, and then to the little drawing-room
adjoining his study. He flung open the door
and showed her the gaily decorated table, pushing
her into the room before him.</p>

<p>“Wine and a kiss!” he roared, as he pulled
the cork from a champagne bottle and sent the
amber fluid splashing upon the spotless tablecloth.
“Wine and a kiss!” He splashed the
glass out to her so that it spilt and trickled
down her cloak.</p>

<p>She shook her head mutely.</p>

<p>“Drink!” he snarled, and she touched the
glass with her lips.</p>

<p>Then, before she could realize what had
happened, she was in his arms, his great face
pressed down to hers. She tried to escape
from the encirclement of his embrace, successfully
averted her mouth and felt his hot lips
pressing against her cheek.</p>

<p>Presently he let her go, and, staggering to
the door, kicked it shut. His fingers were
closing on the key handle when:</p>

<p>“If you turn that key I’ll kill you.”</p>

<p>He looked up in ludicrous surprise, and, at
the sight of the pistol in the girl’s hand, his
big hands waved before his face in a gesture of
fear.</p>

<p>“Put it down, you fool!” he squealed.
“Put it down! Don’t you know what you’re
doing? The damned thing may go off by
accident.”</p>

<p>“It will not go off by accident,” she said.
“Open that door.”</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment, and then her
thumb tightened on the safety-catch, and he
must have seen the movement.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot, don’t shoot!” he screamed,
and flung the door wide open. “Wait, you
fool! Don’t go out. Bhag is there. Bhag
will get you. Stay with me. I’ll——”</p>

<p>But she was flying down the corridor. She
slipped on a loose rug in the hall but recovered
herself. Her trembling hands were working
at the bolts and chains; the door swung open,
and in another instant she was in the open,
free.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory followed her. The shock of her
escape had sobered him, and all the tragic
consequences which might follow came crowding
in upon him, until his very soul writhed in
fear. Dashing back to his study, he opened
his safe, took out a bundle of notes. These he
thrust into the pocket of a fur-lined overcoat
that was hanging in a cupboard and put it on.
He changed his slippers for thick shoes, and
then bethought him of Bhag. He opened the
den, but Bhag was not there, and he raised his
shaking fingers to his lips. If Bhag caught
her!</p>

<p>Some glimmering of a lost manhood stirred
dully in his mind. He must first be sure of
Bhag. He went out into the darkness in search
of his strange and horrible servant. Putting
both hands to his mouth, he emitted a long and
painful howl, the call that Bhag had never yet
disobeyed, and then waited. There was no
answer. Again he sent forth the melancholy
sound, but, if Bhag heard him, for the first time
in his life he did not obey.</p>

<p>Gregory Penne stood in a sweat of fear, but,
so standing, recovered some of his balance.
There was time to change. He went up to his
ornate bedroom, flung off his pyjamas, and in
a short space of time was down again in the
dark grounds, seeking for the ape.</p>

<p>Dressed, he felt more of a man. A long
glass of whisky restored some of his confidence.
He rang for the servant who was in charge of
his car.</p>

<p>“Have the machine by the postern gate,”
he said. “Get it there at once. See that
the gate is open: I may have to leave
to-night.”</p>

<p>That he would be arrested he did not doubt.
Not all his wealth, his position, the pull he
had in the county, could save him. This
latest deed of his was something more than
eccentricity.</p>

<p>Then he remembered that Stella Mendoza
was still in the house, and went up to see her.
A glance at his face told her that something
unusual had happened.</p>

<p>“Where is Adele?” she asked instantly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. She escaped—she had a
pistol. Bhag went after her. God knows what
will happen if he finds her. He’ll tear her limb
from limb. What’s that?”</p>

<p>It was the faint sound of a pistol shot at a
distance, and it came from the back of the
house.</p>

<p>“Poachers,” said Gregory uneasily. “Listen,
I’m going.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That’s no damned business of yours,” he
snarled. “Here’s some money.” He thrust
some notes into her hand.</p>

<p>“What have you done?” she whispered in
horror.</p>

<p>“I’ve done nothing, I tell you,” he stormed.
“But they’ll take me for it. I’m going to get
to the yacht. You’d better clear before they
come.”</p>

<p>She was collecting her hat and gloves when
she heard the door close and the key turn.
Mechanically he had locked her in, and
mechanically took no heed of her beating hand
upon the panel of the door.</p>

<p>Griff Towers stood on high ground and
commanded a view of the by-road from
Chichester. As he stood in the front of the
house, hoping against hope that he would see
the ape, he saw instead two lights come rapidly
along the road.</p>

<p>“The police!” he croaked, and went
blundering across the kitchen garden to the
gate.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch37'>CHAPTER XXXVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AT THE TOWER AGAIN</span></h1></div>

<p>Adele went flying down the drive, intent only
upon one object, to escape from this horrible
house. The gates were closed, the lodge was
in darkness, and she strove desperately to
unfasten the iron catch, but it held.</p>

<p>Looking back toward the oblong of light
which represented the tower door, she was
dimly aware of a figure moving stealthily along
the grass that bordered each side of the roadway.
For a moment she thought it was
Gregory Penne, and then the true explanation
of that skulking shape came to her, and she
nearly dropped. It was Bhag!</p>

<p>She moved as quietly as she could along the
side of the wall, creeping from bush to bush,
but he had seen her, and came in pursuit,
moving slowly, cautiously, as though he was
not quite sure that she was legitimate prey.
Perhaps there was another gate, she thought,
and continued, glancing over her shoulder from
time to time, and gripping the little pistol in
her hand with such intensity that it was slippery
with perspiration before she had gone a hundred
yards.</p>

<p>Now she left the cover of the wall and came
across a meadow, and at first she thought that
she had slipped her pursuer. But Bhag seldom
went into the open, and presently she saw him
again. He was parallel with her, walking under
the wall, and showing no sign of hurry.
Perhaps, she thought, if she continued, he
would drop his pursuit and go off. It might be
curiosity that kept him on her trail. But this
hope was disappointed. She crossed a stile
and followed a path until she realized it was
bringing her nearer and nearer to the wall
where her watcher was keeping pace with her.
As soon as she realized this, she turned
abruptly from the path, and found herself
walking through dew-laden grasses. She was
wet to the knees before she had gone far, but
she did not even know this—Bhag had left
cover and was following her into the open!</p>

<p>She wondered if the grounds were entirely
enclosed by a wall, and was relieved when she
came to a low fence. Stumbling down a bank
on to a road which was evidently the eastern
boundary of the property, she ran at full speed,
though where the road led she could not guess.
Glancing back, she saw, to her horror, that
Bhag was following, yet making no attempt to
decrease the distance which separated them.</p>

<p>And then, far away, she saw the lights of a
cottage. They seemed close at hand, but were
in reality more than two miles distant. With
a sob of thankfulness she turned from the road
and ran up a gentle slope, only to discover, to
her dismay, when she reached the crest, that
the lights seemed as far away as ever. Looking
back, she saw Bhag, his green eyes gleaming
in the darkness.</p>

<p>Where was she? Glancing round, she found
an answer. Ahead and to the left was the squat
outline of old Griff Tower.</p>

<p>And then, for some reason, Bhag dropped
his rôle of interested watcher, and, with a dog-like
growl, leapt at her. She flew upward
toward the tower, her breath coming in sobs,
her heart thumping so that she felt every
moment she would drop from sheer exhaustion.
A hand clutched at her cloak and tore it from
her. That gave her a moment’s respite. She
must face her enemy, or she herself must perish.</p>

<p>Spinning round, her shaking pistol raised,
she confronted the monster, who was growling
and tearing at the clothing in his hand. Again
he crouched to spring, and she pressed the
trigger. The unexpected loudness of the
explosion so startled her that she nearly dropped
the pistol. With a howl of anguish he fell,
gripping at his wounded shoulder, but rose
again immediately. And then he began to
move backward, watching her all the time.</p>

<p>What should she do? In her present position
he might creep from bush to bush and pounce
upon her at any moment. She looked up at
the tower. If she could reach the top! And
then she remembered the ladder that Jack
Knebworth had left behind. But that would
have been collected.</p>

<p>She moved stealthily, keeping her eye upon
the ape, and though he was motionless, she
knew he was watching her. Then, groping in
the grass, her fingers touched the light ladder,
and she lifted it without difficulty and placed
it against the wall. She had heard Jack say
that the ape could not have climbed the tower
from the outside without assistance, though it
had been an easy matter, with the aid of the
trees growing against the wall inside, for him
to get out.</p>

<p>Bhag was still visible; the dull glow of his
eyes was dreadful to see. With a wild run she
reached the top of the ladder and began pulling
it up after her. Bhag crept nearer and nearer
till he came to the foot of the tower, made three
ineffectual efforts to scale the wall and failed.
She heard his twitter of rage, and guided the
ladder to the inside of the tower.</p>

<p>For a long time they sat, looking at one
another, the orang-outang and the girl. And
then Bhag crept away. She followed him as
far as her keen eyes could distinguish his
ungainly shape, waiting until she was certain
he had gone, and then reached for the ladder.
The lower rung must have caught in one of the
bushes below. She tugged, tugged again,
tugged for the third time, and it came away so
smoothly that she lost her balance. For a
second she was holding the top of the wall with
one hand, the ladder with the other; then, half-sliding,
half-tumbling, she came down with a
run, and picked herself up breathless. She
could have laughed at the mishap but for the
eerie loneliness of her new surroundings. She
tried to erect the ladder again, but in the dark
it was impossible to get a firm foundation.</p>

<p>There must be small stones somewhere about,
and she began to look out for them. She
reached the bottom of the circular depression,
and pushing aside a bush to make further
progress, feeling all the time with her feet for
a suitable prop, suddenly she slipped. She
was dropping down a sloping shaft into the
depths of the earth!</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch38'>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE CAVERN OF BONES</span></h1></div>

<p>Down, down, down she fell, one hand clawing
wildly at the soft earth, the other clenching
unconsciously at the tiny pistol. She was
rolling down a steep slope. Once her feet
came violently and painfully into contact with
an out-jutting rock, and the shock and the pain
of it turned her sick and faint. Whither she
was going she dared not think. It seemed an
eternity before, at last, she struck a level floor
and, rolling over and over, was brought up
against a rocky wall with a jolt that shook the
breath from her body.</p>

<p>Eternity it seemed, yet it could not have been
more than a few seconds. For five minutes she
lay, recovering, on the rock floor. She got up
with a grimace of pain, felt her hurt ankle, and
worked her foot to discover if anything was
broken. Looking up, she saw a pale star
above, and, guessing that it was the opening
through which she had fallen, attempted to
climb back; but with every step she took the
soft earth gave under her feet and she slipped
back again.</p>

<p>She had lost a shoe: that was the first tangible
truth that asserted itself. She groped round
in the darkness and found it after a while, half
embedded in the earth. She shook it empty,
dusted her stockinged foot, and put it on.
Then she sat down to wonder what she should
do next. She guessed that, with the coming
of day, she would be able to examine her
surroundings, and she must wait, with what
philosophy she could summon, for the morning
to break.</p>

<p>It was then that she became conscious that
she was still gripping the earth-caked Browning,
and, with a half-smile, she cleaned it as
best she could, pressed down the safety-catch
and, putting the weapon inside her blouse,
thrust its blunt nose into the waistband of her
skirt.</p>

<p>The mystery of Bhag’s reappearance was now
a mystery no longer. He had been hiding in
the cave, though it was her imagination that
supplied the queer animal scent which was
peculiarly his.</p>

<p>How far did the cave extend? She peered
left and right, but could see nothing; then,
groping cautiously, feeling every inch of her
way, her hand struck a stone pillar, and she
withdrew it quickly, for it was wet and clammy.</p>

<p>And then she made a discovery of the greatest
importance to her. She was feeling along the
wall when her hand went into a niche, and by
the surface of its shelf she knew it was man-fashioned.
She put her hand farther along,
and her heart leapt as she touched something
which had a familiar and homely feel. It was
a lantern. Her other hand went up, and
presently she opened its glass door and felt a
length of candle, and, at the bottom of the
lantern, a small box of matches.</p>

<p>It was no miracle, as she was to learn; but
for the moment it seemed that that possibility
of light had come in answer to her unspoken
prayers. Striking a match with a hand that
shook so that the light went out immediately,
she at last succeeded in kindling the wick. The
candle was new, and at first its light was feeble;
but presently the wax began to burn, and,
closing the lantern door, her surroundings came
into view.</p>

<p>She was in a narrow cave, from the roof of
which hung innumerable stalactites; but the
dripping water which is inseparable from this
queer formation was absent at the foot of the
opening where she had tumbled. Farther
along the floor was wet, and a tiny stream of
water ran in a sort of naturally carved tunnel on
one side of the path. Here, where the cave
broadened, the stalactites were many, and left
and right, at such regular intervals and of such
even shape that they seemed almost to have
been sculptured by human agency, were little
caves within caves, narrow openings that
revealed, in the light of her lantern, the
splendour of nature’s treasures. Fairylike
grottos, rich with delicate stone traceries; tiny
lakes that sparkled in the light of the lantern.
Broader and broader grew the cave, until she
stood in a huge chamber that appeared to be
festooned with frozen lace. And here the floor
was littered with queer white sticks. There
were thousands of them, of every conceivable
shape and size. They showed whitely in the
gleam of her lantern, in the crevices of the
rocks. She stooped and picked one up,
dropping it quickly with a cry of horror. They
were human bones!</p>

<p>With a shuddering gasp she half walked, half
ran across the great cavern, which began to
narrow again and assumed the appearance of
that portion of the cave into which she had
fallen. And here she saw, in another niche, a
second lantern, with new candle and matches.
Who had placed them there? The first lantern
she had not dared to think about: it belonged
to the miraculous category. But the second
brought her up with a jerk. Who had placed
these lanterns at intervals along the wall of the
cave, as if in preparation for an expected
emergency? There must be somebody who
lived down here. She breathed a little more
quickly at the thought.</p>

<p>Going on slowly, she examined every foot
of the way, the second lantern, unlighted,
slung on her arm. At one part, the floor was
flooded with running water; at another, she
had to wade through a little subterranean ford,
where the water came over her ankle. And
now the cave was curving imperceptibly to the
right. From time to time she stopped and
listened, hoping to hear the sound of a human
voice, and yet fearing. The roof of the cave
came lower. There were signs in the roof
that the stalactites had been knocked off to
afford head room for the mysterious person
who haunted these underground chambers.</p>

<p>Once she stopped, her heart thumping
painfully at the sound of footsteps. They
passed over her head, and then came a curious
humming sound that grew in intensity, passed
and faded. A motor-car! She was under the
road! Of course, old Griff Tower stood upon
the hillside. She was now near the road
level, and possibly eight or nine feet above
her the stars were shining. She looked
wistfully at the ragged surface of the roof,
and, steeling herself against the terrors that
rose within her, she went on. She had need
of nerve, need of courage beyond the ordinary.</p>

<p>The cave passage turned abruptly; the little
grotto openings in the wall occurred again.
Suddenly she stopped dead. The light of the
lantern showed into one of the grottos. Two
men lay side by side——</p>

<p>She stifled the scream that rose to her lips,
pressing her hands tight upon her mouth, her
eyes shut tightly to hide the sight. They
were dead—headless! Lying in a shallow
pool, the petrifying water came dripping down
upon them, as it would drip down for everlasting
until these pitiful things were stone.</p>

<p>For a long time she dared not move, dared
not open her eyes, but at last her will
conquered, and she looked with outward calm
upon a sight that froze her very marrow.
The next grotto was similarly tenanted, only
this time there was one man. And then,
when she was on the point of sinking under
the shock, a tiny point of light appeared in
the gloom ahead. It moved and swayed, and
there came to her the sound of a fearful
laugh.</p>

<p>She acted instantly. Pulling open the
door of the lantern, she stooped and blew it
out, and stood, leaning against the wall of
the cave, oblivious to the grisly relics that
surrounded her, conscious only of the danger
which lay ahead. Then a brighter light blazed
up and another, till the distant spaces wherein
they burnt were as bright as day. As she
stood, wondering, there came to her a squeal
of mortal agony and a whining voice that
cried:</p>

<p>“Help! Oh, God, help! Brixan, I am
not fit to die!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Sir Gregory Penne.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch39'>CHAPTER XXXIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MICHAEL KNOWS FOR SURE</span></h1></div>

<p>It was that same voice that had brought
Michael Brixan racing across the garden to
the postern gate. A car stood outside, its
lights dimmed. Standing by its bonnet was a
frightened little brown man who had brought
the machine to the place.</p>

<p>“Where is your master?” asked Michael
quickly.</p>

<p>The man pointed.</p>

<p>“He went that way,” he quavered. “There
was a devil in the big machine—it would not
move when he stamped on the little pedal.”</p>

<p>Michael guessed what had happened. At
the last moment, by one of those queer
mischances which haunt the just and the
unjust, the engine had failed him and he had
fled on foot.</p>

<p>“Which way did he go?”</p>

<p>Again the man pointed.</p>

<p>“He ran,” he said simply.</p>

<p>Michael turned to the detective who was
with him.</p>

<p>“Stay here: he may return. Arrest him
immediately and put the irons on him. He’s
probably armed, and he may be suicidal; we
can’t afford to take any risks.”</p>

<p>He had been so often across what he had
named the “Back Field” that he could find
his way blindfolded, and he ran at top speed
till he came to the stile and to the road. Sir
Gregory was nowhere in sight. Fifty yards
along the road, the lights gleamed cheerily
from an upper window in Mr. Longvale’s
house, and Michael bent his footsteps in that
direction.</p>

<p>Still no sight of the man, and he turned
through the gate and knocked at the door,
which was almost immediately opened by the
old gentleman himself. He wore a silken
gown, tied with a sash about the middle, a
picture of comfort, Michael thought.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” asked Mr. Sampson
Longvale, peering out into the darkness.
“Why, bless my life, it’s Mr. Brixan, the
officer of the law! Come in, come in,
sir.”</p>

<p>He opened the door wide and Michael
passed into the sitting-room, with its inevitable
two candles, augmented now by a small silver
reading-lamp that burnt some sort of petrol
vapour.</p>

<p>“No trouble at the Towers, I trust?” said
Mr. Longvale anxiously.</p>

<p>“There was a little trouble,” said Michael
carefully. “Have you by any chance seen
Sir Gregory Penne?”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>“I found the night rather too chilly for my
usual garden ramble,” he said, “so I’ve seen
none of the exciting events which seem
inevitably to accompany the hours of darkness
in these times. Has anything happened to
him?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said Michael quietly. “I
hope, for everybody’s sake, that—nothing has
happened to him.”</p>

<p>He walked across and leant his elbows on
the mantelpiece, looking up at the painting
above his head.</p>

<p>“Do you admire my relative?” beamed Mr.
Longvale.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I admire him. He
was certainly a wonderfully handsome old
gentleman.”</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale inclined his head.</p>

<p>“You have read his memoirs?”</p>

<p>Michael nodded, and the old man did not
seem in any way surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have read what purport to be
his memoirs,” said Michael quietly, “but
latter-day opinion is that they are not
authentic.”</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Personally, I believe every word of them,”
he said. “My uncle was a man of considerable
education.”</p>

<p>It would have amazed Jack Knebworth to
know that the man who had rushed hotfoot
from the tower in search of a possible
murderer, was at that moment calmly
discussing biography; yet such was the
incongruous, unbelievable fact.</p>

<p>“I sometimes feel that you think too much
about your uncle, Mr. Longvale,” said Michael
gently.</p>

<p>The old gentleman frowned.</p>

<p>“You mean——?”</p>

<p>“I mean that such a subject may become an
obsession and a very unhealthy obsession, and
such hero-worship may lead a man to do things
which no sane man would do.”</p>

<p>Longvale looked at him in genuine astonishment.</p>

<p>“Can one do better than imitate the deeds
of the great?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not if your sense of values hasn’t got all
tangled up, and you ascribe to him virtues
which are not virtues—unless duty is a virtue—and
confuse that which is great with that
which is terrible.”</p>

<p>Michael turned and, resting his palms on the
table, looked across to the old man who
confronted him.</p>

<p>“I want you to come with me into Chichester
this evening.”</p>

<p>“Why?” The question was asked bluntly.</p>

<p>“Because I think you’re a sick man, that
you ought to have care.”</p>

<p>The old man laughed and drew himself
even more erect.</p>

<p>“Sick? I was never better in my life, my
dear sir, never fitter, never stronger!”</p>

<p>And he looked all that he said. His height,
the breadth of his shoulders, the healthy glow
of his cheeks, all spoke of physical fitness.</p>

<p>A long pause, and then:</p>

<p>“Where is Gregory Penne?” asked
Michael, emphasizing every word.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea.”</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes met his without
wavering.</p>

<p>“We were talking about my great-uncle.
You know him, of course?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I knew him the first time I saw his
picture, and I thought I had betrayed my
knowledge, but apparently I did not. Your
great-uncle”—Michael spoke deliberately—“was
Sanson, otherwise Longval, hereditary
executioner of France!”</p>

<p>Such a silence followed that the ticking of
a distant clock sounded distinctly.</p>

<p>“Your uncle has many achievements to his
credit. He hanged three men on a gallows
sixty feet high, unless my memory is at fault.
His hand struck off the head of Louis of
France and his consort Marie Antoinette.”</p>

<p>The look of pride in the old man’s face was
startling. His eyes kindled, he seemed to
grow in height.</p>

<p>“By what fantastic freak of fate you come
to have settled in England, what queer kink
of mind decided you secretly to carry on the
profession of Sanson and seek far and wide
for poor, helpless wretches to destroy, I do
not know.”</p>

<p>Michael did not raise his voice, he spoke in
a calm, conversational tone; and in the same
way did Longvale reply.</p>

<p>“Is it not better,” he said gently, “that a
man should pass out of life through no act of
his own, than that he should commit the
unpardonable crime of self-murder? Have I
not been a benefactor to men who dared not
take their own lives?”</p>

<p>“To Lawley Foss?” suggested Michael,
his grave eyes fixed on the other.</p>

<p>“He was a traitor, a vulgar blackmailer, a
man who sought to use the knowledge which
had accidentally come to him, to extract
money from me.”</p>

<p>“Where is Gregory Penne?”</p>

<p>A slow smile dawned on the man’s face.</p>

<p>“You will not believe me? That is
ungentle, sir! I have not seen Sir Gregory.”</p>

<p>Michael pointed to the hearth, where a
cigarette was still smouldering.</p>

<p>“There is that,” he said. “There are his
muddy footprints on the carpet of this room.
There is the cry I heard. Where is he?”</p>

<p>Within reach of his hand was his heavy-calibred
Browning. A move on the old man’s
part, and he would lie maimed on the ground.
Michael was dealing with a homicidal lunatic
of the most dangerous type, and would not
hesitate to shoot.</p>

<p>But the old man showed no sign of
antagonism. His voice was gentleness itself.
He seemed to feel and express a pride in
crimes which, to his brain, were not crimes at
all.</p>

<p>“If you really wish me to go into Chichester
with you to-night, of course I will go,” he said.
“You may be right in your own estimation,
even in the estimation of your superiors, but,
in ending my work, you are rendering a cruel
disservice to miserable humanity, to serve
which I have spent thousands of pounds. But
I bear no malice.”</p>

<p>He took a bottle from the long oaken buffet
against the wall, selected two glasses with
scrupulous care, and filled them from the
bottle.</p>

<p>“We will drink our mutual good health,” he
said with his old courtesy, and, lifting his glass
to his lips, drank it with that show of
enjoyment with which the old-time lovers of
wine marked their approval of rare vintages.</p>

<p>“You’re not drinking?” he said in surprise.</p>

<p>“Somebody else has drunk.”</p>

<p>There was a glass half empty on the buffet:
Michael saw it for the first time.</p>

<p>“He did not seem to enjoy the wine.”</p>

<p>Mr. Longvale sighed.</p>

<p>“Very few people understand wine,” he
said, dusting a speck from his coat. Then,
drawing a silk handkerchief from his pocket,
he stooped and dusted his boots daintily.</p>

<p>Michael was standing on a strip of hearth-rug
in front of the fireplace, his hand on his gun,
tense but prepared for the moment of trial.
Whence the danger would come, what form it
would take, he could not guess. But danger
was there—danger terrible and ruthless,
emphasized rather than relieved by the suavity
of the old man’s tone—he felt in the creep of
his flesh.</p>

<p>“You see, my dear sir,” Longvale went on,
still dusting his boots.</p>

<p>And then, before Michael could realize what
had happened, he had grasped the end of the
rug on which the detective was standing and
pulled it with a quick jerk toward him.
Before he could balance himself, Michael had
fallen with a crash to the floor, his head
striking the oaken panelling, his pistol sliding
along the polished floor. In a flash, the old
man was on him, had flung him over on his
face and dragged his hands behind him.
Michael tried to struggle, but he was as a child
in that powerful grip, placed at such a
disadvantage as he was. He felt the touch of
cold steel on his wrists, there was a click, and,
exerting all his strength, he tried to pull his
other hand away. But gradually, slowly, it
was forced back, and the second cuff snapped.</p>

<p>There were footsteps on the path outside the
cottage. The old man straightened himself to
pull off his silken gown and wrapped it round
and round the detective’s head, and then a
knock came at the door. One glance to see
that his prisoner was safe, and Longvale
extinguished the lamp, blew out one of the
candles, and carried the other into the passage.
He was in his shirt-sleeves, and the Scotland
Yard officer, who was the caller, apologized for
disturbing a man who had apparently been
brought down from his bedroom to answer the
knock.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Mr. Brixan?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brixan? Yes, he was here a few
minutes ago. He went on to Chichester.”</p>

<p>Michael heard the voices, but could not distinguish
what was being said. The silken
wrapper about his head was suffocating him,
and he was losing his senses when the old man
came back alone, unfastened the gown, and
put it on himself.</p>

<p>“If you make a noise I will sew your lips
together,” he said, so naturally and good-naturedly
that it seemed impossible he would
carry his threat into execution. But Michael
knew that he was giving chapter and verse; he
was threatening that which his ancestor had
often performed. That beautiful old man,
nicknamed by the gallants of Louis’ court
“Monsieur de Paris,” had broken and hanged
and beheaded, but he had also tortured men.
There were smoke-blackened rooms in the old
Bastille where that venerable old hangman had
performed nameless duties without blenching.</p>

<p>“I am sorry in many ways that you must go
on,” said the old man, with genuine regret in
his voice. “You are a young man for whom
I have a great deal of respect. The law to me
is sacred, and its officers have an especially
privileged place in my affections.”</p>

<p>He pulled open a drawer of the buffet and
took out a large serviette, folded it with great
care and fixed it tightly about Michael’s mouth.
Then he raised him up and sat him on a chair.</p>

<p>“If I were a young and agile man, I would
have a jest which would have pleased my uncle
Charles Henry. I would fix your head on the
top of the gates of Scotland Yard! I’ve
often examined the gates with that idea in my
mind. Not that I thought of you, but that
some day providence might send me a very
high official, a Minister, even a Prime Minister.
My uncle, as you know, was privileged to
destroy kings and leaders of parties—Danton,
Robespierre, every great leader save Murat.
Danton was the greatest of them all.”</p>

<p>There was an excellent reason why Michael
should not answer. But he was his own cool
self again, and though his head was aching
from the violent knock it had received, his
mind was clear. He was waiting now for the
next move, and suspected he would not be kept
waiting long. What scenes had this long
dining-room witnessed! What moments of
agony, mental and physical! It was the very
antechamber to death.</p>

<p>Here, then, Bhag must have been rendered
momentarily unconscious. Michael guessed
the lure of drugged wine, that butyl chloride
which was part of the murderer’s equipment.
But for once Longvale had misjudged the
strength of his prey. Bhag must have followed
the brown folk to Dower House—the man and
woman whom the old man in his cunning had
spared.</p>

<p>Michael was soon to discover what was going
to happen. The old man opened the door of
the buffet and took out a great steel hook, at
the end of which was a pulley. Reaching up,
he slipped the end of the hook into a steel bolt,
fastened in one of the overhead beams.
Michael had noticed it before and wondered
what purpose it served. He was now to
learn.</p>

<p>From the cupboard came a long coil of rope,
one end of which was threaded through the
pulley and fastened dexterously under the
detective’s armpits. Stooping, Longvale
lifted the carpet and rolled it up, and then
Michael saw that there was a small trap-door,
which he raised and laid back. Below he could
see nothing, but there came to him the sound
of a man’s groaning.</p>

<p>“Now I think we can dispense with that,
sir,” said Mr. Longvale, and untied the
serviette that covered the detective’s mouth.</p>

<p>This done, he pulled on the rope, seemingly
without an effort, and Michael swung in mid-air.
It was uncomfortable; he had an absurd
notion that he looked a little ridiculous. The
old man guided his feet through the opening
and gradually paid out the rope.</p>

<p>“Will you be good enough to tell me when
you touch ground,” he asked, “and I will come
down to you?”</p>

<p>Looking up, Michael saw the square in the
floor grow smaller and smaller, and for an
unconscionable time he swung and swayed and
turned in mid-air. He thought he was not
moving, and then, without warning, his feet
touched ground and he called out.</p>

<p>“Are you all right?” said Mr. Longvale
pleasantly. “Do you mind stepping a few
paces on one side? I am dropping the rope,
and it may hurt you.”</p>

<p>Michael gasped, but carried out instructions,
and presently he heard the swish of the falling
line and the smack of it as it struck the ground.
Then the trap-door closed, and there was no
other sound but the groaning near at hand.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Penne?”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked the other in a frightened
voice. “Is it you, Brixan? Where are we?
What has happened? How did I get here?
That old devil gave me a drink. I ran out—and
that’s all I remember. I went to borrow
his car. My God, I’m scared! The magneto
of mine went wrong.”</p>

<p>“Did you shout when you ran from the
house?”</p>

<p>“I think I did. I felt this infernal
poison taking effect and dashed out—I don’t
remember. Where are you, Brixan? The
police will get us out of this, won’t they?”</p>

<p>“Alive, I hope,” said Michael grimly, and
he heard the man’s frightened sob, and was
sorry he had spoken.</p>

<p>“What is he? Who is he? Are these the
caves? I’ve heard about them. It smells
horribly earthy, doesn’t it? Can you see anything?”</p>

<p>“I thought I saw a light just then,” said
Michael, “but my eyes are playing tricks.”
And then: “Where is Adele Leamington?”</p>

<p>“God knows,” said the other. He was
shivering, and Michael heard the sound of his
chattering teeth. “I never saw her again. I
was afraid Bhag would go after her. But he
wouldn’t hurt her—he is a queer devil. I wish
he was here now.”</p>

<p>“I wish somebody was here,” said Michael
sincerely.</p>

<p>He was trying to work his wrists loose of
the handcuffs, though he knew that bare-handed
he stood very little chance against the
old man. He had lost his pistol, and although,
in the inside of his waistcoat, there remained
intact the long, razor-sharp knife that had
cleared him out of many a Continental scrape,
the one infallible weapon when firearms failed,
he knew that he would have no opportunity
for its employment.</p>

<p>Sitting down, he tried to perform a trick that
he had seen on a stage in Berlin—the trick of
bringing his legs through his manacled hands
and so getting his hands in front of him, but
he struggled without avail. There came the
sound of a door opening, and Mr. Longvale’s
voice.</p>

<p>“I won’t keep you a moment,” he said. He
carried a lantern in his hand that swung as he
walked, and seemed to intensify the gloom.
“I don’t like my patients to catch cold.”</p>

<p>His laughter came echoing back from the
vaulted roof of the cave, intensified hideously.
Stopping, he struck a match and a brilliant
light appeared. It was a vapour lamp fixed on
a shelf of rock. Presently he lit another, and
then a third and a fourth, and, in the white,
unwinking light, every object in the cave stood
out with startling distinctness. Michael saw
the scarlet thing that stood in the cave’s centre,
and, hardened as he was, and prepared for that
fearsome sight, he shuddered.</p>

<p>It was a guillotine!</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch40'>CHAPTER XL<br/> <span class='sub-head'>“THE WIDOW”</span></h1></div>

<p>A guillotine!</p>

<p>Standing in the middle of the cave, its
high framework lifted starkly. It was painted
blood-red, and its very simplicity had a horror
of its own.</p>

<p>Michael looked, fascinated. The basket,
the bright, triangular knife suspended at the
top of the frame, the tilted platform with its
dangling straps, the black-painted lunette
shaped to receive the head of the victim and
hold it in position till the knife fell in its oiled
groove. He knew the machine bolt by bolt,
had seen it in operation on grey mornings
before French prisons, with soldiers holding
back the crowd, and a little group of officials
in the centre of the cleared space. He knew
the sound of it, the “<i>clop!<i>” as it fell, sweeping
to eternity the man beneath.</p>

<p>“ ‘The Widow’!” said Longvale humorously.
He touched the frame lovingly.</p>

<p>“Oh God, I’m not fit to die!” It was
Penne’s agonized wail that went echoing
through the hollow spaces of the cavern.</p>

<p>“The Widow,” murmured the old man
again.</p>

<p>He was without a hat; his bald head shone
in the light, yet there was nothing ludicrous
in his appearance. His attitude toward this
thing he loved was in a sense pathetic.</p>

<p>“Who shall be her first bridegroom?”</p>

<p>“Not me, not me!” squealed Penne,
wriggling back against the wall, his face ashen,
his mouth working convulsively. “I’m not
fit to die——”</p>

<p>Longvale walked slowly over to him,
stooped and raised him to his feet.</p>

<p>“Courage!” he murmured. “It is the
hour!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Jack Knebworth was pacing the road when
the police car came flying back from Chichester.</p>

<p>“He’s not there, hasn’t been to the station
at all,” said the driver breathlessly as he flung
out of the car.</p>

<p>“He may have gone into Longvale’s house.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen Mr. Longvale: it was he who
told me that the Captain had gone into
Chichester. He must have made a mistake.”</p>

<p>Knebworth’s jaw dropped. A great light
suddenly flashed upon his mind. Longvale!
There was something queer about him. Was
it possible——?</p>

<p>He remembered now that he had been
puzzled by a contradictory statement the old
man had made; remembered that, not once
but many times, Sampson Longvale had
expressed a desire to be filmed in a favourite
part of his own, one that he had presented, an
episode in the life of his famous ancestor.</p>

<p>“We’ll go and knock him up. I’ll talk to
him.”</p>

<p>They hammered at the door without
eliciting a response.</p>

<p>“That’s his bedroom.” Jack Knebworth
pointed to a latticed window where a light
shone, and Inspector Lyle threw up a pebble
with such violence that the glass was broken.
Still there was no response.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that,” said Knebworth suddenly.</p>

<p>“You don’t like it any better than I do,”
growled the officer. “Try that window,
Smith.”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to open it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, without delay.”</p>

<p>A second later, the window of the long
dining-room was prized open; and then they
came upon an obstacle which could not be so
readily forced.</p>

<p>“The shutter is steel-lined,” reported the
detective. “I think I’d better try one of the
upper rooms. Give me a leg up, somebody.”</p>

<p>With the assistance of a fellow, he reached
up and caught the sill of an open window, the
very window from which Adele had looked
down into the grinning face of Bhag. In
another second he was in the room, and was
reaching down to help up a second officer. A
few minutes’ delay, and the front door was
unbarred and opened.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody in the house, so far as I
can find out,” said the officer.</p>

<p>“Put a light on,” ordered the inspector
shortly.</p>

<p>They found the little vapour lamp and lit it.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” The detective officer
pointed to the hook that still hung in the
beam with the pulley beneath, and his eyes
narrowed. “I can’t understand that,” he said
slowly. “What was that for?”</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Here’s Brixan’s gun!” he said, and picked
it up from the floor.</p>

<p>One glance the inspector gave, and then his
eyes went back to the hook and the pulley.</p>

<p>“That beats me,” he said. “See if you
fellows can find anything anywhere. Open
every cupboard, every drawer. Sound the
walls—there may be secret doors; there are in
all these old Tudor houses.”</p>

<p>The search was futile, and Inspector Lyle
came back to a worried contemplation of the
hook and pulley. Then one of his men came
in to say that he had located the garage.</p>

<p>It was an unusually long building, and
when it was opened, it revealed no more than
the old-fashioned car which was a familiar
object in that part of the country. But
obviously, this was only half the accommodation.
The seemingly solid whitewashed wall
behind the machine hid another apartment,
though it had no door, and an inspection of
the outside showed a solid wall at the far end
of the garage.</p>

<p>Jack Knebworth tapped the interior wall.</p>

<p>“This isn’t brickwork at all, it’s wood,”
he said.</p>

<p>Hanging in a corner was a chain.
Apparently it had no particular function, but
a careful scrutiny led to the discovery that
the links ran through a hole in the roughly
plastered ceiling. The inspector caught the
chain and pulled, and, as he did so, the
“wall” opened inwards, showing the contents
of the second chamber, which was a second car,
so sheeted that only its radiator was visible.
Knebworth pulled off the cover, and:</p>

<p>“That’s the car.”</p>

<p>“What car?” asked the inspector.</p>

<p>“The car driven by the Head-Hunter,”
said Knebworth quickly. “He was in that
machine when Brixan tried to arrest him. I’d
know it anywhere! Brixan is in the Dower
House somewhere, and if he’s in the hands of
the Head-Hunter, God help him!”</p>

<p>They ran back to the house, and again the
hook and pulley drew them as a magnet.
Suddenly the police officer bent down and
jerked back the carpet. The trap-door
beneath the pulley was plainly visible. Pulling
it open, he knelt down and gazed through.
Knebworth saw his face grow haggard.</p>

<p>“Too late, too late!” he muttered.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch41'>CHAPTER XLI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE DEATH</span></h1></div>

<p>The shriek of a man half crazy with fear is not
nice to hear. Michael’s nerves were tough, but
he had need to drive the nails into the palms
of his manacled hands to keep his self-control.</p>

<p>“I warn you,” he found voice to say, as the
shrieking died to an unintelligible babble of
sound, “Longvale, if you do this, you are
everlastingly damned!”</p>

<p>The old man turned his quiet smile upon
his second prisoner, but did not make any
answer. Lifting the half-conscious man in his
arms as easily as though he were a child, he
carried him to the terrible machine, and laid
him, face downwards, on the tilted platform.
There was no hurry. Michael saw, in Longvale’s
leisure, an enjoyment that was unbelievable.
He stepped to the front of the machine
and pulled up one half of the lunette; there
was a click, and it remained stationary.</p>

<p>“An invention of mine,” he said with pride,
speaking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Michael looked away for a second, past the
grim executioner, to the farther end of the cave.
And then he saw a sight that brought the blood
to his cheeks. At first he thought he was
dreaming, and that the strain of his ordeal was
responsible for some grotesque vision.</p>

<p>Adele!</p>

<p>She stood clear in the white light, so grimed
with earth and dust that she seemed to be
wearing a grey robe.</p>

<p>“If you move I will kill you!”</p>

<p>It was she! He twisted over on to his
knees and staggered upright. Longvale heard
the voice and turned slowly.</p>

<p>“My little lady,” he said pleasantly. “How
providential! I’ve always thought that the
culminating point of my career would be, as
was the sainted Charles Henry’s, that moment
when a queen came under his hand. How
very singular!”</p>

<p>He walked slowly toward her, oblivious to
the pointed pistol, to the danger in which he
stood, a radiant smile on his face, his small,
white hands extended as to an honoured guest.</p>

<p>“Shoot!” cried Michael hoarsely. “For
God’s sake, shoot!”</p>

<p>She hesitated for a second and pressed the
trigger. There was no sound—clogged with
earth, the delicate mechanism did not act.</p>

<p>She turned to flee, but his arm was round
her, and his disengaged hand drew her head
to his breast.</p>

<p>“You shall see, my dear,” he said. “The
Widow shall become the Widower, and you
shall be his first bride!”</p>

<p>She was limp in his arms now, incapable of
resistance. A strange sense of inertia overcame
her; and, though she was conscious, she
could neither of her own volition, move nor
speak. Michael, struggling madly to release
his hands, prayed that she might faint—that,
whatever happened, she should be spared
a consciousness of the terror.</p>

<p>“Now who shall be first?” murmured the
old man, stroking his shiny head. “It would
be fitting that my lady should show the way,
and be spared the agony of mind. And
yet——” He looked thoughtfully at the
prostrate figure strapped to the board, and,
tilting the platform, dropped the lunette about
the head of Gregory Penne. The hand went
up to the lever that controlled the knife. He
paused again, evidently puzzling something
out in his crazy mind.</p>

<p>“No, you shall be first,” he said, unbuckled
the strap and pushed the half-demented man
to the ground.</p>

<p>Michael saw him lift his head, listening.
There were hollow sounds above, as of people
walking. Again he changed his mind, stooped
and dragged Gregory Penne to his feet.
Michael wondered why he held him so long,
standing so rigidly; wondered why he dropped
him suddenly to the ground; and then
wondered no longer. Something was crossing
the floor of the cave—a great, hairy something,
whose malignant eyes were turned upon the old
man.</p>

<p>It was Bhag! His hair was matted with
blood; his face wore the powder mask which
Michael had seen when he emerged from
Griff Towers. He stopped and sniffed at the
groaning man on the floor, and his big paw
touched the face tenderly. Then, without
preliminary, he leapt at Longvale, and the old
man went down with a crash to the ground, his
arms whirling in futile defence. For a second
Bhag stood over him, looking down, twittering
and chattering; and then he raised the man
and laid him in the place where his master had
been, tilting the board and pushing it forward.</p>

<p>Michael gazed with fascinated horror. The
great ape had witnessed an execution! It was
from this cave that he had escaped, the night
that Foss was killed. His half-human mind
was remembering the details. Michael could
almost see his mind working to recall the
procedure.</p>

<p>Bhag fumbled with the frame, touched the
spring that released the lunette, and it fell
over the neck of the Head-Hunter. And at
that moment, attracted by a sound, Michael
looked up, saw the trap above pulled back.
Bhag heard it also, but was too intent upon his
business to be interrupted. Longvale had
recovered consciousness and was fighting to
draw his head from the lunette. Presently
he spoke. It was as though he realized the
imminence of his fate, and was struggling to
find an appropriate phrase, for he lay quiescent
now, his hands gripping the edge of the narrow
platform on which he lay.</p>

<p>“Son of St. Louis, ascend to heaven!” he
said, and at that moment Bhag jerked the
handle that controlled the knife.</p>

<p>Inspector Lyle from above saw the blade
fall, heard the indescribable sound of the thud
that followed, and almost swooned. Then,
from below:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, inspector. You may find a
rope in the buffet. Get down as quickly as
you can and bring a gun.”</p>

<p>The buffet cupboard contained another rope,
and a minute later the detective was going
down hand over hand.</p>

<p>“There’s no danger from the monkey,” said
Michael.</p>

<p>Bhag was crooning over his senseless
master, as a mother over her child.</p>

<p>“Get Miss Leamington away,” said Michael
in a low voice, as the detective began to unlock
the handcuffs.</p>

<p>The girl lay, an inanimate and silent figure,
by the side of the guillotine, happily oblivious
of the tragedy which had been enacted in her
presence. Another detective had descended
the rope, and old Jack Knebworth, despite
his years, was the third to enter the cave. It
was he who found the door, and aided the
detective to carry the girl to safety.</p>

<p>Unlocking the handcuffs from the baronet’s
wrists, Michael turned him over on his back.
One glance at the face told the detective that
the man was in a fit, and that his case, if not
hopeless, was at least desperate. As though
understanding that the man had no ill intent
toward his master, Bhag watched passively,
and then Michael remembered how, the first
time he had seen the great ape, Bhag had
smelt his hands.</p>

<p>“He’s filing you for future reference as a
friend,” had said Gregory at the time.</p>

<p>“Pick him up,” said Michael, speaking
distinctly in the manner that Gregory had
addressed the ape.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Bhag stooped and lifted
the limp man in his arms, and Michael guided
him to the stairway and led him up the stairs.</p>

<p>The house was full of police, who gaped at
the sight of the great ape and his burden.</p>

<p>“Take him upstairs and put him on the bed,”
ordered Michael.</p>

<p>Knebworth had already taken the girl off in
his car to Chichester, for she had shown signs
of reviving, and he wanted to get her away
from that house of the dead before she fully
recovered.</p>

<p>Michael went down into the cave again and
joined the inspector. Together they made a
brief tour. The headless figures in the niches
told their own story. Farther on, Michael
came to the bigger cavern, with its floor littered
with bones.</p>

<p>“Here is confirmation of the old legend,” he
said in a hushed voice, and pointed. “These
are the bones of those warriors and squires who
were trapped in the cave by a landslide. You
can see the horses’ skeletons quite plainly.”</p>

<p>How had Adele got into the cave? He was
not long before he found the slide down which
she had tumbled.</p>

<p>“Another mystery is explained,” he said.
“Griff Tower was obviously built by the
Romans to prevent cattle and men from falling
through into the cave. Incidentally, it has
served as an excellent ventilator, and I have no
doubt the old man had this way prepared, both
as a hiding-place for the people he had killed
and as a way of escape.”</p>

<p>He saw a candle-lantern and matches that
the girl had missed, and this he regarded as
conclusive proof that his view was right.</p>

<p>They came back to the guillotine with its
ghastly burden, and Michael stood in silence
for a long time, looking at the still figure
stretched on the platform, its hands still clutching
the sides.</p>

<p>“How did he persuade these people to come
to their death?” asked the inspector in a voice
little above a whisper.</p>

<p>“That is a question for the psychologist,”
said Michael at last. “There is no doubt that
he got into touch with many men who were contemplating
suicide but shrank from the act, and
performed this service for them. I should
imagine his practice of leaving around their
heads for identification arose out of some poor
wretch’s desire that his wife and family should
secure his insurance.</p>

<p>“He worked with extraordinary cunning.
The letters, as you know, went to a house of
call and were collected by an old woman, who
posted them to a second address, whence they
were put in prepared envelopes and posted,
ostensibly to London. I discovered that the
envelopes were kept in a specially light-proof
box, and that the unknown advertiser had
stipulated that they should not be taken out of
that box until they were ready for posting. An
hour after those letters were put in the mail the
address faded and became invisible, and
another appeared.”</p>

<p>“Vanishing ink?”</p>

<p>Mike nodded.</p>

<p>“It is a trick that criminals frequently
employ. The new address, of course, was
Dower House. Put out the lights and let
us go up.”</p>

<p>Three lamps were extinguished, and the
detective looked round fearfully at the shadows.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll leave this down here,” he said.</p>

<p>“I think we will,” said Michael, in complete
agreement.</p>
<!--se:split-->
<div><h1 id='ch42'>CHAPTER XLII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CAMERA!</span></h1></div>

<p>Three months had passed since the Dower
House had yielded up its grisly secrets. A
long enough time for Gregory Penne to recover
completely and to have served one of the six
months’ imprisonment to which he was sentenced
on a technical charge. The guillotine
had been re-erected in a certain Black Museum
on the Thames Embankment, where young
policemen come to look upon the equipment of
criminality. People had ceased to talk about
the Head-Hunter.</p>

<p>It seemed a million years ago to Michael as
he sat, perched on a table, watching Jack
Knebworth, in the last stages of despair,
directing a ruffled Reggie Connolly in the
business of love-making. Near by stood
Adele Leamington, a star by virtue of the
success that had attended a certain trade show.</p>

<p>Out of range of the camera, a cigarette
between her fingers, Stella Mendoza, gorgeously
attired, watched her some time friend
and prospective leading man with good-natured
contempt.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody can tell me, Mr. Knebworth,”
said Reggie testily, “how to hold a
girl! Good gracious, heavens alive, have I
been asleep all my life? Don’t you think I
know as much about girls as you, Mr. Knebworth?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a darn how you hold your girl,”
howled Jack. “I’m telling you how to hold <em>my</em>
girl! There’s only one way of making love,
and that’s <em>my</em> way. I’ve got the patent rights!
Your arm round her waist again, Connolly.
Hold your head up, will you? Now turn it this
way. Now drop your chin a little. Smile,
darn you, smile! Not a prop smile!” he
shrieked. “Smile as if you liked her. Try
to imagine that she loves you! I’ll apologize
to you, afterwards, Adele, but try to imagine
it, Connolly. That’s better. You look as if
you’d swallowed a liqueur of broken glass!
Look down into her eyes—look, I said,
not glare! That’s better. Now do that
again——”</p>

<p>He watched, writhing, gesticulating, and at
last, in cold resignation:</p>

<p>“Rotten, but it’ll have to do. Lights!”</p>

<p>The big Kreisler lights flared, the banked
mercury lamps burnt bluely, and the flood
lamps became blank expanses of diffused
light. Again the rehearsal went through, and
then:</p>

<p>“Camera!” wailed Jack, and the handle
began to turn.</p>

<p>“That’s all for you to-day, Connolly,” said
Jack. “Now, Miss Mendoza——”</p>

<p>Adele came across to where Michael was
sitting and jumped up on to the table beside
him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Knebworth is quite right,” she said,
shaking her head. “Reggie Connolly doesn’t
know how to make love.”</p>

<p>“Who does?” demanded Michael. “Except
the right man?”</p>

<p>“He’s supposed to be the right man,” she
insisted. “And, what’s more, he’s supposed to
be the best lover on the English screen.”</p>

<p>“Ha ha!” said Michael sardonically.</p>

<p>She was silent for a time, and then:</p>

<p>“Why are you still here? I thought
your work was finished in this part of the
world.”</p>

<p>“Not all,” he said cheerfully. “I’ve still
an arrest to make.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him quickly.</p>

<p>“Another?” she said. “I thought, when
you took poor Sir Gregory——”</p>

<p>“Poor Sir Gregory!” he scoffed. “He
ought to be a very happy man. Six months’
hard labour was just what he wanted, and he
was lucky to be charged, not with the killing
of his unfortunate servant but with the concealment
of his death.”</p>

<p>“Whom are you arresting now?”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” said Michael, “whether I
shall arrest her.”</p>

<p>“Is it a woman?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“What has she done?”</p>

<p>“The charge isn’t definitely settled,” he said
evasively, “but I think there will be several
counts. Creating a disturbance will be one;
deliberately endangering public health—at any
rate, the health of one of the public—will be
another; maliciously wounding the feelings——”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>you</em>, you mean?”</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>“I thought that was part of your delirium
that night at the hospital, or part of mine.
But as other people saw you kiss me, it must
have been yours. I don’t think I want to
marry,” she said thoughtfully. “I am——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that you are wedded to your art,”
he groaned. “They all say that!”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not wedded to anything, except a
desire to prevent my best friend from making a
great mistake. You’ve a very big career in
front of you, Michael, and marrying me is not
going to help you. People will think you’re
just infatuated, and when the inevitable divorce
comes along——”</p>

<p>They both laughed together.</p>

<p>“If you have finished being like a maiden
aunt, I want to tell you something,” said
Michael. “I’ve loved you from the moment I
saw you.”</p>

<p>“Of course you have,” she said calmly.
“That’s the only possible way you <em>can</em> love a
girl. If it takes three days to make up your
mind it can’t be love. That’s why I know I
don’t love you. I was annoyed with you the
first time I met you; I was furious with you the
second time; and I’ve just tolerated you ever
since. Wait till I get my make-up off.”</p>

<p>She got down and ran to her dressing-room.
Michael strolled across to comfort an exhausted
Jack Knebworth.</p>

<p>“Adele? Oh, she’s all right. She really
has had an offer from America—not Hollywood,
but a studio in the East. I’ve advised her not
to take it until she’s a little more proficient,
but I don’t think she wanted any advice. That
girl isn’t going to stay in the picture business.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think that, Knebworth?”</p>

<p>“She’s going to get married,” said Jack
glumly. “I can recognize the signs. I told
you all along that there was something queer
about her. She’s going to get married and
leave the screen for good—that’s her eccentricity.”</p>

<p>“And whom do you think she will marry?”
asked Michael.</p>

<p>Old Jack snorted.</p>

<p>“It won’t be Reggie Connolly—that I can
promise you.”</p>

<p>“I should jolly well say not!” said that
indignant young man, who had remarkably keen
ears. “I’m not a marrying chap. It spoils an
artist. A wife is like a millstone round his
neck. He has no chance of expressing his
individuality. And whilst we are on that
subject, Mr. Knebworth, are you perfectly sure
that I’m to blame? Doesn’t it strike you—mind
you, I wouldn’t say a word against the
dear girl—doesn’t it strike you that Miss
Leamington isn’t quite—what shall I say?—seasoned
in love—that’s the expression.”</p>

<p>Stella Mendoza had strolled up. She had
returned to the scene of her former labours,
and it looked very much as if she were coming
back to her former position.</p>

<p>“When you say ‘seasoned’ you mean
‘smoked,’ Reggie,” she said. “I think you’re
wrong.”</p>

<p>“I can’t be wrong,” said Reggie complacently.
“I’ve made love to more girls in
this country than any other five leading men,
and I tell you that Miss Leamington is distinctly
and fearfully immature.”</p>

<p>The object of their discussion appeared at
the end of the studio, nodded a cheery good
night to the company and went out, Michael
on her heels.</p>

<p>“You’re fearfully immature,” he said, as he
guided her across the road.</p>

<p>“Who said so? It sounds like Reggie: that
is a favourite word of his.”</p>

<p>“He says you know nothing whatever about
love-making.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I don’t,” she said shortly, and so
baffling was her tone that he was not prepared
to continue the subject, until they reached the
long, dark road in which she lived.</p>

<p>“The proper way to make love,” he said,
more than a little appalled at his own boldness,
“is to put one hand on the waist——”</p>

<p>Suddenly she was in his arms, her cool face
against his.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any way,” she murmured.
“One just does!”</p>
